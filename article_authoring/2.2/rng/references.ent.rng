<!-- SYSTEM:     Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite -->
<!---->
<!-- PURPOSE:    Defines the bibliographic reference elements -->
<!---->
<!---->
<!-- CONTAINS:   1) Default definition of the references class -->
<!-- 2) Parameter Entities for attribute lists -->
<!-- 3) Models for the bibliographic reference -->
<!-- class elements in alphabetical order -->
<!---->
<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers who wish to -->
<!-- create a custom XML DTD for original markup of -->
<!-- journal literature, books, and related material, -->
<!-- or for archiving and transferring such material -->
<!-- between archives. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and a new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- module to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the Archiving and -->
<!-- Interchange DTD Suite and intend to stay -->
<!-- compatible with the suite, then please include -->
<!-- the following statement as a comment in all of -->
<!-- your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the Archiving and Interchange DTD -->
<!-- Suite." -->
<!---->
<!-- Suggestions for refinements and enhancements to -->
<!-- the DTD suite should be sent in email to: -->
<!-- archive-dtd@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov -->

<!-- Bruce Rosenblum (Inera Inc.) -->
<!---->
<!-- NLM thanks the Harvard University Libraries, both -->
<!-- for proposing that a draft archiving NLM DTD for -->
<!-- life sciences journals be extended to accommodate -->
<!-- journals in all disciplines and for sponsoring -->
<!-- Bruce Rosenblum's collaboration with other DTD -->

<!-- DTD VERSION/CHANGE HISTORY -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
  
       =============================================================
  
  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
  
       =============================================================
       Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
  
       Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
       Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
       required elements optional.
  
  
   12. PERSON-GROUP=TYPE ATTRIBUTE VALUES - Added "director" to
       list of suggested values for CDATA attribute
  
   11. Updated public identifier to "v2.2 20060430//EN"          
  
       =============================================================
       Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
  
       Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
       Added new material requested by NCBI   
  
  
   14. Minor, non-functional changes to element order in PEs and to 
       wording in comments as part of 2.1 release (e.g., "doaj")
  
   13. Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" 
  
       =============================================================
       Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
  
       Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
       DTD version "2.0":
         a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
            DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
            archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
            current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
            archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
            DTD).
         b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
            and June/July 2004 followup discussions
         c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
            modularization requirements
         d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
            easier and more consistent
  
   12. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
       (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
       ### Customization Alert ###
       Added internal parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed 
       them from Element Declaration for:
       - %note-model;
       - %ref-list-model;
       - %ref-model;
       - and removed the parentheses for <person-group>
  
   11. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
       %default-classes.ent;
  
   10. REFERENCES.CLASS - Added the following elements to the
       %references.class;:
        - <issue-id>
        - <issue-title>
        - <page-range>
        - <role>
        - <string-name>
        - <volume-id>
  
    9. EMAIL AND URI
       a. Added to %source-elements; by changing 
           %ext-links.class; ==> %address-link.class;
  
    8. LOOSENING ELEMENT USAGE in Archiving DTD and Suite
       a. Rewrote content model for access-date as a new Parameter
          Entity %access-date-elements;
       b. Allowed all date components (%date-part.class;)
          inside this PE in Archiving DTD (Green) customization
       c. The default value is the empty string in this module,
          therefore, access date, by default, contains nothing 
          but #PCDATA.
  
    7. ROLE ELEMENT - Was added to the default references class 
       %references.class;
  
    6. PERSON GROUP - To add <string-name> as well as correct various
       classing problems:
  
       a. Content model was made into a Parameter Entity
          %person-group-model;
  
       b. The content model was changed to incorporate the new
           -%name.class;, which adds both <string-name> and <collab>
  
    5. NAME CLASS / STRING NAME
       a. Created a new element <string-name> for names that
          do not follow the former, strict personal name model.
  
       b. Created a new class %name.class; to hold all the ways
          to name people: <name>, <string-name>, and <collab>
          who produce products or articles. Used in:
          - <person-group>
  
       c. To allow <string-name> to be used anywhere <name> is
          used:
          - Added to default %references.class;
  
    4. NEW PARAMETER ENTITIES - To correct potential classing 
       problems, created the following new Parameter Entities:
       a. NEW CLASSES
          - %just-para.class; used in <annotation>, -%note-model;
          - %ref-list.class; used in <ref-list>
       b. NEW MIXES 
          - <edition>       -%edition-elements;
          - <gov>           -%gov-elements;
          - <patent>        -%patent-elements;
          - <series-title>  -%series-title-elements;
          - <std>           -%std-elements;
          - <time-stamp>    -%time-stamp-elements;
  
  
    3. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"         
  
       =============================================================
       Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
  
    2. Added element <page-count> to parameter entity 
       %references.class;
       Rationale:  Permit tagging of page count where included in
       references.
  
       =============================================================
       Version 1.0 Post Publishing DTD Change (DAL) v 1.0 2003-02-10
  
    1. Removed <other-ref>, since the Publishing (authoring) DTD did
       not need it and that is what it had been made for. It was 
       never to be used for conversion or interchange, so it's gone.
       Removed %other-ref-elements; as well. It did not need to be 
       removed from any context, as it was never used.

    xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
    element is expressed.  Recommended best 
    practice is to use values as defined in
    RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
    codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
    and "DE" (German). These values are NOT
    case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
    may include hyphenated differentiations such 
    as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
    (United States English).

    Authoring Note: The optional paragraph-level
    elements after the title allow for those rare
    cases where there is explanatory material
    inside the list, before the references. There
    may also be similar explanatory material 
    inside each reference group. Explanatory
    material preceding a citation will need to
    be placed inside the citation.

  <!--

    the Comment in a Citation <comment> element.
    Design Note: All inline mixes begin with an
    OR bar, but since %simple-phrase; is an 
    inline mix, the OR bar is already there.
  -->
  <!-- COMMENT IN A CITATION -->
  <!--
    Used to mark unstructured text within an
    otherwise element structured reference.
    In an unstructured reference, this text would
    merely be data characters.
    Typical comments could include:
      <comment>[Abstract]</comment>
      <comment> translated from Russian</comment>
    Design Note: The <comment> element is defined
    here largely for the sake of conversion, to
    preserve the semantic markup when translating
    from other DTDs.
    Authoring and Conversion Note: The Comment
    element should be used to mark substantive
    text only; it should NOT be used to markup
    punctuation that occurs between elements.
    Display Note: Comments should appear inline
    with other reference elements.  This is a
    very different rendering from that given the
    similar element Annotation, which is
    typically a longer commentary concerning a
    citation that is rendered as a block
    element.
    Design Note: All inline mixes begin with an
    OR bar, but since %simple-phrase; is an 
    inline mix, the OR bar is already there.
