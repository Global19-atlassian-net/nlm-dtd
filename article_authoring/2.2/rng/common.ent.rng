<!-- SYSTEM:     Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite -->
<!---->
<!-- PURPOSE:    Defines the common parameter entities, calls the -->
<!-- shared modules (such as special characters and -->
<!-- notations) and provides declarations for elements -->
<!-- that do not properly fit into one class, since -->
<!--              they can be used at more than one structural level -->
<!---->
<!-- CONTAINS:   1) Default classes for elements defined in this -->
<!-- module.  May be overridden by values in the -->
<!-- DTD's Customization Module -->
<!-- 2) Parameter Entities for attribute values -->
<!-- 3) Parameter Entities for content models -->
<!-- 4) Parameter Entities for attribute lists -->
<!-- 5) Elements used in many modules/classes -->
<!-- - Address elements -->
<!-- - Date elements -->
<!-- - Personal name elements -->
<!-- - Common metadata elements (shared by both -->
<!-- article metadata and bibliographic -->
<!-- reference metadata -->
<!---->
<!-- MODULES REQUIRED: -->
<!-- 1) Standard XML Special Characters Module -->
<!-- (%xmlspecchars.ent;) -->
<!-- 2) Custom XML Special Characters (%chars.ent;) -->
<!-- 3) Notation Declarations    (%notat.ent;) -->
<!---->
<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- Digital archives and publishers who wish to -->
<!-- create a custom XML DTD for original markup of -->
<!-- journal literature, books, and related material, -->
<!-- or for archiving and transferring such material -->
<!-- between archives. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and a new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- module to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the Archiving and -->
<!-- Interchange DTD Suite and intend to stay -->
<!-- compatible with the suite, then please include -->
<!-- the following statement as a comment in all of -->
<!-- your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the Archiving and Interchange DTD -->
<!-- Suite." -->
<!---->
<!-- Suggestions for refinements and enhancements to -->
<!-- the DTD suite should be sent in email to: -->

<!-- DTD VERSION/CHANGE HISTORY -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
  
       =============================================================
  
  Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
  
       =============================================================
       Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
  
       Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
       Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
       required elements optional.
  
   33. RELATED ARTICLE TYPE - Added new suggested value for 
       "partial-retraction"
  
   32. PRICE - Added new elements <price> and made a new class for it
       (-%price.class;) so that it can be added to <product>
  
   31. SIG-BLOCK - Added new elements <sig-block>. A <sig-block> 
       may be located at the end of the <body> in journal articles 
       (Blue and Green) and at the end of sections <sec> in books.
  
   30. LONG DESC - Added asterisk to the model for <long-desc>       
  
   29. SECTION MODELS
  
       a. Added new element <sec-meta> to the start of the content
          models for section (-%sec-model;) and section optional
          title model (-%sec-opt-title-model;). There are sections that
          are authored independently, even in journal articles, and 
          this is the start of allowing additional metadata for such
          sections. The first content for <sec-meta> will be 
          <contrib-group>
  
       b. New Parameter Entity -%sec-meta-model; to hold the
          content of the new element.
  
       c. New element declaration for <sec-meta>
  
   28. Updated public identifier to "v2.2 20060430//EN"          
  
       =============================================================
       Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
  
       Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
       Added new material requested by NCBI   
  
   27. JOURNAL-ID-ATTS - Removed the duplicate declaration
  
   26. RELATED-ARTICLE-ATTS - Changed to use the journal-id-atts
       Parameter Entity, which was moved to allow this use
  
   25. PUB-ID-TYPES - Added new values "doaj" and "manuscript"
       to pub-id-types and suggested journal ID types
  
   24. PERMISSIONS - Added a new <permissions> wrapper element to
       consolidate copyright and licensing information. For backwards
       compatibility, the new element will be added alongside the
       existing copyright elements. Best practice will be to use the
       new container, but <copyright-statement>, <copyright-year>,
       and <license> will be accepted in their old positions inside
       <article-meta>
        - Added <permissions> to the following models:
           - article-meta>
        - Added <copyright-holder> to <permissions>
        - Moved <copyright-year> here from article-meta module
        - Moved <license> here from article-meta module
        - Moved -%license-atts; here from article-meta module
        - Moved -%license-model; here from article-meta module
  
   23. DATE ATTS PARAMETER ENTITY - The Parameter Entity -%date-atts;
       was defined, but not used on the <date> element. Since the
       attribute list was hard-coded at the element, it could not
       be over-ridden. PE is now used.
  
   22. X-GENERATED TEXT - Added "xml:space" attribute with a value of
       "preserve" to the <x> element
  
   21. JOURNAL TITLES
         a) Defined new element <journal-subtitle>; used in
            <journal-meta>
  
   20. Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" 
  
       =============================================================
       Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
  
  
       Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
       DTD version "2.0":
         a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
            DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
            archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
            current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
            archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
            DTD).
         b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
            and June/July 2004 followup discussions
         c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
            modularization requirements
         d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
            easier and more consistent
  
  
   29. NEW ELEMENT <x> GENERATED TEXT AND PUNCTUATION
       Added a container element to hold punctuation or other 
       generated text, typically when 1) an archive decides not 
       to have any text generated and thus to pre-generate such 
       things as commas or semicolons between keywords or 2) 
       when an archive receives text with <x> tags embedded and 
       wishes to retain them.
  
   28. PUBLISHER - Moved element here from %journalmeta.ent;
       module since Book DTD also needed it and was not including
       that module.
  
   27. PAGE ELEMENT ATTRIBUTES
       a. Made an Parameter Entity for:
          - %fpage-atts;
          - %elocation-id-atts;
       b. Gave %elocation-id-atts" the attribute "seq"
  
   26. PUB ID TYPES - Added the new attribute values to the
       Parameter Entity %pub-id-types;, which is used on <article>
       and other elements. New values: pmcid and art-access-id
  
   25. CUSTOM METADATA - Added the new <custom-meta> element, its
       components, and its wrapper. This element is used to insert
       name/value pairs for metadata elements that are in source
       material but were never envisioned by this DTD. Allowed this
       element at the end of <article-meta>.
  
   24. DATES 
       a. Made a new Parameter Entity %string-date-elements; to
          hold all the elements that may be mixed with #PCDATA
          inside a <string-date>
       b. Also used %date-parts.class; and %x.class; (currently
          used only in Green-Archiving) in the new PE 
          %string-date-elements;
  
   23. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
       (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
       ### Customization Alert ###
       Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
       the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
       as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
       #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
       contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
       designed to prohibit element content and permit only
       #PCDATA or mixed content.) Added parentheses to Parameter
       Entity and removed them from the Element Declaration.
       - %custom-meta-model;
       - %custom-meta-wrap-model;
       - %def-model;
       - %sec-model;
       - %sec-opt-title-model;
       - Removed parentheses from <notes>, <ack>, <address>, <date>
  
   22. CITATION MODEL / COPYRIGHT STATEMENT MODEL
       ### Customization Alert ###
       a. Replaced the Parameter Entity %copyright-statement-model; 
          with the OR list Parameter Entity 
          %copyright-statement-elements; and used that
          within the content model of <copyright-statement>
       b. Citation - In the PE %citation-elements; also
          changed the PE -%ext-links.class; ==> -%address-links.class;
          (Changed the content model of citation to match.)
       c. In -%copyright-statement-elements;, replaced the mix 
          -%rendition-plus; with its  constituent classes
       d. In -%citation-elements;, replaced the mix -%simple-text;
          with its constituent classes (with exception of 
          %address-link.class;).
  
   21. RELATED ARTICLE
       ### Customization Alert ###
        - Renamed 
           -%related-article-model; ==> -%related-article-elements;
            (To match the DTD naming convention that full content 
            models are named with a "-model" suffix and groups of 
            elements to be added to #PCDATA for a particular
            content model are named "-elements".)
        - Started "-related-article-elements" PE with an OR Bar
        - Deleted "ext-links.class", because these elements are 
          already in the %references.class; (no model change)
  
   20. INLINE MATH - <inline-formula> added to:
       - %label-elements; 
  
   19. RELATED ARTICLE ATTRIBUTES - Added the following attributes
       to the element <related-article>:
       a.  "id" - to provide a unique identifier
       b.  "alternate-form-of", which works (similarly to the same 
           attribute when used on a <graphic> element) to point to 
           another <related-article> element within the same document 
           as an alternate form of the related article.
  
   18. ISSUE TITLE <issue-title> - Created new element for a theme or
       special issue title
          - Defined here in the common module
          - Added to <article-meta>
          - Added to %references.class; (therefore to <citation>,
            <product>, and <related-article>
          - Created new Parameter Entities %issue-title-elements; 
            which hold the OR-group of elements that may be mixed with 
            #PCDATA inside the content model 
  
   17. ATTRIBUTION
        - Moved <attrib> and its Parameter Entities from the paragraph
          module to here, as it is numerous elements, such as <array>, 
          <boxed-text>, <fig>, <table-wrap>, etc., in the Archival DTD.
  
   16. CUSTOM METADATA - Added the new <custom-meta> element, its
       components, and its wrapper. This element is used to insert
       name/value pairs for metadata elements that are in source
       material but were never envisioned by this DTD. Allowed this
       element at the end of <article-meta> and <journal-meta>.
  
   15. EMAIL- Considered to be just another type of external link, as
       <ext-link> is, so added to:
       - %collab-elements;
       - %copyright-statement-elements;
  
   14. DATES 
       a. Added new class %date-parts.class; to hold all the
          potential components of date, such as <year>, <day>,
          etc.
       b. Made a new Parameter Entity %string-date-elements; to
          hold all the elements that may be mixed with #PCDATA
          inside a <string-date>
       c. Used %date-parts.class; in that model.
  
   13. ROLE ELEMENT - Was added to the model for <citation>, thus
       moved to this module from the article metadata module.
  
  
   12. NEW IDENTIFICATION ELEMENTS - in view of the larger role that 
       some publishers are giving to DOIs:
  
       a. OBJECT ID  -  Added a new class Parameter Entity 
          %id.class; to hold the new element <object-id> Object 
          Identifier. The <object-id> element is used to capture any 
          publisher's or archive's ID, such as a DOI. This was modeled 
          as an element (rather than as an attribute) to allow for 
          multiple  IDs. New PE used in:
            - %references.class (therefore inside <citation>, 
               <related-article>, and <product>)
            - metadata objects such as <abstract>
            - display objects such as <figure>.
          Added PE %object-id-atts; to hold the element's attributes
  
       b. ISSUE ID <issue-id> - new element for an identifier such 
          as a DOI associated with a journal issue (as opposed to the 
          existing element <issue>, which is defined as the issue 
          number) 
          - Defined here in the common module
          - Added to <article-meta>
          - Added to %references.class; (therefore to <citation>,
            <product>, and <related-article>
          - Created PE %issue-id-atts; to hold the attributes.
  
       c. VOLUME ID <volume-id> - new element for an identifier such 
          as a DOI associated with a volume of a journal (as opposed 
          to the  existing element <volume>, which is defined as the 
          volume number) 
          - Defined here in the common module
          - Added to <article-meta>
          - Added to %references.class; (therefore to <citation>,
            <product>, and <related-article>
          - Created new Parameter Entities %volume-id-elements; 
            which hold the OR-group of elements that may be mixed with 
            #PCDATA inside the content model 
          - Added PE %volume-id-atts; to hold the attributes.
  
  
       Note: All ID attributes for these new identification
       elements was set to use the "pub-id-type" attribute, 
       which is for Archival (Green) set as a CDATA attribute.
  
   11. NAME CLASS / STRING NAME / PERSON NAME CLASS
       a. Created a new element <string-name> for names that
          do not follow the former, strict personal name model.
          <string-name> holds any combination of #PCDATA and any of 
          the known personal-name elements such as <surname>.
          - Used a new Parameter Entity %string-name-elements;
            in the content model
  
       b. Created a new class %name.class; to hold all the ways
          to name people: <name>, <string-name>, and <collab>
          who produce products or articles.
  
       c. Allowed <string-name> to be used anywhere <name> is
          used. Inside
           - citation (by adding to %references.class;)
           - product  (by adding to %references.class;)
  
       d. Added new attribute "initials" to the personal name
          components: <surname> and <given-names>. This provides
          a way to preserve the initials, for matching services
          that prefer initials to full names. Since there are
          many cases in which the initials cannot be determined
          programmatically, we merely provide a bucket to record
          them.
  
       e. Added new Parameter Entities %given-name-atts; and
          %surname-atts; to hold the new "initials" attribute.
  
   10. ATTRIBUTE VALUE LISTS - The Green (Archival) DTD needed to
       change all explicit attribute value lists in the DTD to CDATA. 
       In the future, explicit list types will be a feature of the
       Blue (Publishing) and new Authoring DTDs. Therefore, added
       Parameter Entities to hold the following attributes:
         - date-type
  
    9. RELATED ARTICLE ATTRIBUTES - Added the following attributes
       to the element <related-article>:
        - "id ID #IMPLIED" attribute, so the related-article
          can be referenced.
        - "ext-link-type" - to indicate the type of link used to 
          point to the related article. Attribute was used with 
          exactly the same content (CDATA) and suggested values 
          as when used with the element <ext-link>.
        - "issue" - used (along with "vol", "page", and "journal-id")
           to provide metadata concerning the related article
        - "journal-id"- used (along with "vol", "page", and "issue")
           to provide metadata concerning the related article.
        - "journal-id-type" - Performs the same function that this
          attribute performs for the element <journal-id>. The
          "journal-id"  values are the same as those for existing 
          journal identifiers plus "issn".
        - "alternate-form-of", which works (similarly to the same 
          attribute when used on a <graphic> element) to point to 
          another <related-article> element within the same document 
          as an alternate form of the related article.
  
    8. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION
  
       a. RENAME ELEMENT MIXES NOT TO END IN "-elements", since that
          suffix is reserved for mixes that are added to #PCDATA in
          a particular element
          ### Customization Alert ###
          Names ending in "-elements" saved for element-specific mixes
          that will be added to #PCDATA for one element
          -  %sec-back-matter-elements; ==> %sec-back-matter-mix;
                 (Used in -%sec-model; and -%sec-opt-title-model;)
  
       b. NEW CLASSES - Largely for classing and modification reasons,
          the following new classes were added:
          - %date.class;
          - %def.class;
          - %degree.class;
          - %id.class; 
          - Removed duplicate %person-name.class;
  
       c. NEW MIXES - To correct potential classing problems, new 
          Parameter Entities were created. The following content 
          models were changed to use these new entities.
          - <etal>           -%etal-elements;
          - <ext-link>       -%ext-link-elements;
          - <fax>            -%fax-elements;
          - <given-names>    -%given-names-elements;
          - <issn>           -%issn-elements;
          - <issue>          -%issue-elements;
          - <label>          -%label-elements;
          - <long-desc>      -%long-desc-elements;
          - <phone>          -%phone-elements;
          - <prefix>         -%prefix-elements;
          - <publisher-name> -%publisher-name-elements;
          - <role>           -%role-elements;

       d. RENAME CLASSES
          ### Customization Alert ###
          Not all classes ended in the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
          following to add the class suffix:
          - %address-elements; (renamed -%address.class;) used in 
              - %aff-elements; 
              - %publisher-loc-elements;
              - %address-model;
          - %inline-math.class; used in -%label-elements; 
  
       e. PE %attrib-elements;
          ### Customization Alert ###
          Uses %emphasized-text; which now starts with an OR bar, so
          removed the OR bar from this PE.
  
       f. LINK CLASSES
          - In %aff-elements;, replaced %link.class; with
            the following classes (via use of %all-phrase;)
            (no DTD change):
              - %address-link.class;  (external used in addresses)
              - %simple-link.class;   (the internal links, same)
              - %article-link.class;  (for journal articles)
         -  In -%collab-elements;
              - Replaced -%ext-links.class; with the following class
                (via use of %all-phrase;)
                (no DTD change):
                - address-link.class; (external used in addresses)
              - Deleted -%inpara-address; 
                (No model change, %address-link.class; covers it.)
         -  In %copyright-statement-elements;, replaced 
            -%inpara-address; with -%address-link.class;
            (via use of %all-phrase;)
  
    7. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
       %default-classes.ent;
  
    6. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830" 
  
       =============================================================
       Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
  
    5. Made <copyright-statement> model into a parameter entity in 
       order to add <ext-link> to the content model.
       Rationale:  Permit linkage between copyright statement and 
       copyright holder's site.
  
    4. Added attribute "content-type" to element <ack>. 
       Rationale: To identify and preserve the semantic intent of 
       semantically rich source documents.
  
    3. Added ID attribute to the following elements:
         - <ack> 
         - <address> 
         - <alt-text>
         - <ext-link> (by modifying %ext-link-atts;)
         - <institution>
         - <long-desc> 
         - <notes> (by modifying parameter entity %notes-atts;)
       Rationale: Provide unique identifier so these elements can be 
       linked to.  
  
    2. Added element <label> to content model of <aff> (by adding
       -%label.class; to parameter -%aff-elements;)
       Rationale: To provide <label>  when needed for format 
       over-ride.
  
       =============================================================
       Version 1.0 Changes Before Public Release
                                         (Lapeyre) v1.0 (2002-12-25)
  
    1. ETAL - Changed the content model of <etal> to replace the
       entire content model with a Parameter Entity, not just name 
       some elements that may mix with #PCDATA. Rationale: The 
       Authoring DTD would like to make <etal> EMPTY.

  <!--
    Used to identify an article that

    For a printed article, when citations are 
    sent through the Medline matcher to be turned
    into live links or when the metadata about an
    article is collected for complete
    identification,  the first page number (and 
    sometimes  also the last page number) of the 
    article is recorded to help indicate which
    article is being referenced. Electronic only
    journals have no page numbers, so this
    element is used as the equivalent identifier,
    the "electronic page number" that helps to
    identify the article. The value could be an 
    article identifier, a doi, etc., for 
    example, "E70".                        
    Remarks: This element is more accurately an
    electronic identifier, and it was considered
    renaming this element to that. The purpose
    of the name is to be a parallel with the
    <fpage>...<lpage> model. When neither first
    page or last page is appropriate, because
    the electronic journal has no pages, the
    <elocation-id> element is used instead.

    citation into a live link:
       source  The MEDLINE abbreviation of the
               journal name
       article-title  
               Title of the article
       volume  Volume of the journal
       issue   Issue of the journal
       fpage   Page number on which the article
               starts
       name    Of an author or editor
       year    Year of publication
       month   Month of publication (if present)
       day     Date of publication (if present)
    The other elements may be tagged if
    desired.  The <title> element may be used
    for titles of books, conference proceedings,
    etc.
    Authoring and Conversion Note: In order to 
    make citations into live links, as much
    of the author and date information as is
    available should be preserved. The most
    important date tag is year, and it should
    always be tagged if possible:
        <year>2003</year> 
    The <day> and <month> tags will be used
    more rarely; they are provided because some
    of the citation matching services can use
    the month and the day if they are available.
