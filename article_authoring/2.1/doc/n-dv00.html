         <p class="para">This Authoring DTD comprises a handful of DTD-specific modules that set up Parameter Entity over-rides and uses (by reference)
            the base modules of the full Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite. The modules of that Suite were developed as part
            of an effort to create XML applications through which materials on health-related disciplines could be shared and reused electronically.
            Although the full Suite was developed to support electronic production, the structures should be adequate to support some
            print production as well.  The Suite has been used to construct many DTDs in addition to this one.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Because this is a authoring DTD, thus optimized for creating new content, the DTD is far smaller (fewer elements, and fewer
            choices in many contexts) than either the Archiving or the Publishing DTDs. Where, in the Archiving DTD, there may have been
            several ways to express the same information, the goal was to allow only one way in this authoring DTD. It was not the intention
            to limit the expressive power licensed by this DTD, but rather to limit the meaningless choices that a full interchange DTD
            needs to make to accommodate conversion from as wide a variety of formats as possible. The philosophy for the Archiving DTD
            was to accept as many varied forms of many structures as possible unchanged. The philosophy for the Publishing DTD was to
            accept a wide variety of structures and to regularize those that matter to the archive. The philosophy of this Authoring DTD
            is to prefer a single structural form, or at least a single style of tagging, whenever possible. Similarly the Archiving and
            Publishing DTDs allow for formatting such as list numbering and citation references to be preserved. This DTD assumes that
            such objects will need to be generated as part of production.

         <div class="section"><a name="modulardesign"></a><h2 class="header">Modular DTD Design</h2>
            <p class="para">This DTD Suite has been written as a series of XML DTD modules
                      that can be combined into a number of different DTDs. The modules are separate
                      physical files that, taken together, define all element structures (such as
                      tables, math, chemistry, paragraphs, sections, figures, footnotes, and
                      reference elements), as well as attributes and entities in the Suite.
            </p>
            <p class="para">Modules in the Suite are primarily intended to group elements for maintenance.
                      There are different kinds of modules. A module may either:
                      
               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li>Be a building block for a base DTD (such as the <a href="n-84f0.html"><span class="pename">Module to Name the Modules</span></a> module)
                  </li>
                  <li>Define the elements inside a particular structure. For
                                example, the <a href="n-qqf0.html"><span class="pename">Bibliography References (Citation) Elements Module</span></a> module names all the potential components of
                                bibliographic reference lists.
                  </li>
                  <li>Name the members of a &#8220;class&#8221; of elements,
                                where class is a named grouping of elements that share a similar usage or
                                potential location. For example, the <a href="n-8df0.html"><span class="pename">Phrase-Level Content Elements Module</span></a> module defines small floating
                                elements that may occur within text, such as inside a paragraph or a title, or
                                that describe textual content, for example, a disease name, drug name, or the
                                name of a discipline.
                  </li>
                  <li>Be a module of &#8220;editorial convenience&#8221;. For
                                example, the <a href="n-at70.html"><span class="pename">Common (Shared) Element Declarations Module</span></a> module holds elements and attributes used in the
                                content models of the various class elements.
                  </li>
               </ul> 
            </p>
            <p class="para">There are many advantages to such a modular approach. The smaller
                units are written once, maintained in one place, and used in many different
                DTDs. This makes it much easier to keep lower level structures consistent
                across document types, while allowing for any real differences that analysis
                identifies. A DTD for a new function (such as a repository DTD) or a new
                publication type can be built quickly, since most of the necessary components
                will already be defined in the DTD Suite. Editorial and production personnel
                can bring the experience gained on one tagging project directly to the next
                with very little loss or retraining. Customized software (including authoring,
                typesetting, and electronic display tools) can be written once, shared among
                projects, and modified only for real distinctions.

         <div class="section"><a name="developed"></a><h2 class="header">DTDs from the Base Suite</h2>
            <p class="para">A number of DTDs have already been developed from
                the modules in the full Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite and more are being developed. The DTDs produced for the National
               Library of Medicine include:
                
               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li>Archiving and Interchange DTD &#8212; (Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD, nicknamed &#8220;Green&#8221;) A DTD into which
                      publishers&#8217; original XML (or SGML) content can be converted, providing a
                      common format for storing this material and for transferring content to any one of a number of archives. This DTD has been
                     designed to be very open and
                      inclusive&#8212;to allow journal articles to be translated from a wide variety of
                      proprietary journal article DTDs. It is permissive by design, intended to capture whatever warts and wrinkles exist in a
                     Publishers&#8217; content.
                  </li>
                  <li>Publishing DTD &#8212; (Journal Publishing DTD, nicknamed &#8220;Blue&#8221;) A DTD for use as a repository DTD by archives which desire consistent
                     processing and searching capability. The Journal Publishing DTD is a more prescriptive and restrictive subset of the Journal
                     Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite than the Archiving DTD (above). This DTD may also be used to transfer content between
                     archives.
                  </li>
                  <li>Authoring DTD &#8212; (Authoring DTD, nicknamed &#8220;Pumpkin&#8221;) A DTD intended for writing and editing <em>new</em> journal articles. The Authoring DTD will be designed to enable &#8220;good&#8221; journal coding and to provide assistance to authors
                     and editors through more restricted models than the interchange and repository DTDs allow.
                  </li>
                  <li>Book DTD &#8212; (nicknamed &#8220;Purple&#8221;) A DTD intended for preserving book and monograph content for use in electronic websites.</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="para">There is one and only one element in the authoring DTD that is not in the Archiving DTD (although it is in the Publishing
               DTD): the <a href="n-hb80.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;nlm-citation&gt;</span></a> element. This citation model, although loose enough to accommodate the full range of citation types in the NLM Guidelines,
               is far more prescriptive than the <a href="n-efc0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;citation&gt;</span></a> model of the base Suite. The NLM citation model and the extensive examples of tagged citations provided are intended to encourage
               the creation of citations according to NLM&#8217;s guidelines.

               <p class="para">Parameter Entities are the
                         major mechanism for customizing a DTD or creating a new DTD from the modules in
                         the full Suite. Individual DTDs will be constructed by 1) establishing element and
                         attribute combinations and content models using Parameter Entities in one of the DTD-specific customizing modules and
                  2) choosing appropriate modules from the Suite that declare the elements needed.
                         For example, if the base DTD contained 6 kinds of lists
                         and 2 table models, a more specific DTD might use a
                         Customize Classes Module to redefine the List Class to name only 3 lists and
                         redefine the Display Class to allow only one table model.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The standard modules to create a customized DTD are: 1) the DTD itself, 2) a module to name its component modules, and 3)
                  as many over-ride modules (class, mix, and/or model) and  new elements modules as necessary. Thus, typical modules for a new
                  DTD are:
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>DTD &#8212; The DTD module (<tt>articleauthoring.dtd</tt>) for the new DTD base DTD (At a minimum, this module declares the top-level element (such as article, book, help-topic, or
                        report) and any other structural elements
                                   unique to the new document type.);
                     </li>
                     <li>DTD-specific Module of Modules &#8212; The DTD-specific module of modules, to name all the new modules created expressly for the

                     <li>Model Over-rides &#8212; DTD-specific content model over-rides for the content
                           models in the modules of the suite (using &#8220;<tt>-elements</tt>&#8221; and &#8220;<tt>-model</tt>&#8221; Parameter Entities); and

                     <li>New Model Modules &#8212; DTD-specific new elements (for example, a new Book DTD might add book-specific metadata elements or a

                  <p class="para">The basic idea for a new DTD is that all lower-level elements (paragraphs, lists,
                     figures, etc.) will be defined in modules &#8212; either the modules of the base DTD Suite or in new DTD-specific modules rather
                     than in the DTD itself. The new DTD
                     will be fairly short and include only definitions of the topmost elements, at least the document element and maybe its children.
                  </p>
                  <p class="para">Modules are defined (declared) using External Parameter Entities in the Suite&#8217;s <a href="n-84f0.html"><span class="pename">Module to Name the Modules</span></a> or in the DTD-specific Module of Modules. Modules are called (referenced) in the DTD proper, <em>in the order needed</em> to define the Parameter Entities in sequence.
                  </p>
                  <p class="para">This Authoring DTD was written as an example of the new best-practice customization technique. A new variant DTD that follows
                     this plan will probably consist of the following modules:
                     
                     <ul class="bullist">
                        <li>A DTD module to define the top-level elements (for example, <tt>articleauthoring.dtd</tt>);

                        <li>A DTD-specific Module of Modules to name new non-Suite modules in the DTD (for example, <a href="n-3k70.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-modules.ent;</span></a>);
                        </li>
                        <li>A DTD-specific definition of element classes to add new classes and over-ride the default classes (for example, <a href="n-bmt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>);

                  <p class="para">To show the process, here is a series of instructions for making a new DTD, illustrated by showing how the Authoring DTD was
                     created from the modules of the whole Suite.
                     <ol class="olist">
                        <li><strong>Modules</strong> &#8212; Write a new DTD-specific Module of Modules, which
                           defines all new customization modules the DTD needs. (As an example,  the Authoring DTD created the
                           module <a href="n-3k70.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-modules.ent;</span></a>, which contains the definitions of the class-over-ride module <a href="n-bmt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>, the mix-over-ride module <a href="n-xzt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-mixes.ent;</span></a>, and the models-over-ride module <a href="n-hzt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-models.ent;</span></a>.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Class Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Write a DTD-specific class-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the Suite classes. These classes are defined in the default classes module, <tt>%default-classes.ent;</tt>.  (As an example, the Authoring DTD created the module <a href="n-bmt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-classes.ent;</span></a>, in which several new models, including <tt>%rest-of-para.class.class;</tt> and <tt>%name.class;</tt>, were declared.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mix Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Write a DTD-specific mix-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the Suite mixes. These mixes are defined in the default mixes module, <tt>%default-mixes.ent;</tt>.  (As an example, the Authoring DTD created the module <a href="n-xzt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-mixes.ent;</span></a>, in which mixes such as <tt>%emphasized-text;</tt> and <tt>%simple-phrase;</tt> were declared.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Model Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Create a DTD-specific content-model-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the  content models and
                           attribute lists for the DTD Suite. (As an example, the Authoring DTD created the module <a href="n-hzt0.html"><span class="petag">%articleauthcustom-models.ent;</span></a>, in which element collections (suffixed &#8220;<tt>-elements</tt>&#8221;) that will be mixed with <tt>#PCDATA</tt> were redefined, full content models over-rides (suffixed &#8220;<tt>-model</tt>&#8221;) were redefined, and some new attributes and attribute lists were added.) 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>New Elements</strong> &#8212; Write any new element modules needed. These will define any new block-level or phrase-level elements. (As an example, the
                           Authoring DTD includes the module <tt>%nlmcitation.ent;</tt>, in which a more prescriptive citation element, <tt>&lt;nlm-citation&gt;</tt>, is declared. The module <tt>%nlmcitation.ent;</tt> was initially written as part of the Journal Publishing DTD and is used without change by this DTD.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>DTD Module</strong> &#8212; With those modules in place, construct a new DTD module. Within that module:

                              </li>
                              <li>Use an External Parameter Entity reference to call any DTD-specific module defining block-level or phrase-level elements.
                                 (For the Authoring DTD, the module <tt>%nlmcitation.ent;</tt> in which a more prescriptive citation element, <tt>&lt;nlm-citation&gt;</tt>, is declared)
                              </li>
                              <li>Select, from the Module of Modules, those modules which
                                 contain the elements needed for the DTD (for instance, selecting lists and not
                                 selecting math elements) and calling in each of the modules needed. (The Authoring DTD calls these in alphabetical order,
                                 since the order does not matter.)
                              </li>

                                 elements and entities needed for this DTD. (For example, the Authoring DTD declares only four elements &#8212; <tt>&lt;article&gt;</tt> [the top-level element] and its components: <tt>&lt;front&gt;</tt>,
                                 <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&lt;back&gt;</tt>.)

                        and attribute names taken from PUBLIC modules (e.g., MathML and various table modules) incorporated into these DTDs are in
                        the case in which they were found in the original module.

                     </li>
                     <li>WORD STANDARDIZATION &#8212; Abbreviations are standardized so that, for example, &#8220;keyword&#8221; is always used as &#8220;kwd&#8221; (as in the element
                        <a href="n-ww80.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;kwd-group&gt;</span></a>) and group is not abbreviated (as in the element <a href="n-ww80.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;kwd-group&gt;</span></a>).

                  <p class="para">PARAMETER ENTITY: SAME FUNCTION, SAME NAME &#8212; The Suite modules and initial DTDs have used a series of Parameter Entity naming
                     conventions consistently. While parsing software cannot enforce these Parameter Entity naming or usage conventions, these
                     conventions can make it much easier for a person to know how the content models work and what must be modified to make a DTD
                     change.

                  <p class="para"><strong>CLASSES</strong> &#8212; Classes are functional groupings of elements used together in an OR group. Each class is named with a Parameter Entity,

                  <p class="para"><strong>MIXES</strong> &#8212; Mixes are functional OR groups of classes; mixes should never contain element names directly.  All mixes must be declared

Mix names have no set suffix; for example, they may end in &#8220;<tt>-mix</tt>&#8221; or &#8220;<tt>-elements</tt>&#8221;. Content models and content model over-rides use mixes and classes for all OR groups. Only content model sequences are made

                  <p class="para"><strong>MODEL OVER-RIDES</strong> &#8212; Parameter Entity mixes for over-riding a content model are of two styles: 1) inline mixes and 2) full content model replacements.
                     These two groupings have been defined and named separately to preserve the mixed-content or element-content nature of the
                     models in DTDs derived from the Suite.

                  tagged according to this DTD Suite would be to limit the names and path names to these characters: letters (both upper and
                  lower case), numbers, underscore, hyphen, and period. All such names will be assumed to be case sensitive. DOS-style file
                  extensions may be used.
