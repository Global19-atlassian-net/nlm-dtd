THIS SCHEMA IS NOT INTENDED FOR MAINTENANCE. This Schema has been generated automatically from the corresponding NCBI DTD. While the structural constraints on document tagging expressed by this schema are identical to those of the DTD, changes to the schema are best made by making the analogous changes to the DTD, and regenerating a schema from the modified DTD.

The Schema has been tested and found to perform properly in James Clark's Jing Validator running in syncROsoft oXygen (version 6.2).
