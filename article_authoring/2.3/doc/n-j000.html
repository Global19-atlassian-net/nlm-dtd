         <p class="para">The Article Authoring Tag Set (hereafter Authoring Tag Set) can be used to create new journal articles tagged with XML elements.
            The Tag Set defines the elements (and their attributes) that describe the content of most journal articles, as well the content
            of some non-article journal material, such as editorials and book reviews. A person using this Tag Set is typically one of
            the article&#8217;s authors or someone (such as a copyeditor) to whom the author has sent the XML files. The Tag Set is intended
            for use with XML-aware software or text-editors to guide the writer in choosing tags correctly. This Tag Set is a simplified
            version of the Journal Publishing (Blue) Tag Set, which describes the biological and medical journal articles archived in
            PubMed Central.
         </p>
         <p class="para">This Tag Library provides the documentation for the Authoring Tag Set including examples of element and attribute usage. The
            documentation is divided in to two levels: 1) author documentation for the person writing or editing textual material who
            wants to use the tags and 2) implementor documentation, which is more detailed for people who need to modify or maintain the
            DTDs or schemas. The author-level reference material includes:
             
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>This brief introduction;</li>
               <li>An explanation of how to read and use this Tag Library;</li>
               <li>A top-level introduction to the <a href="n-3r20.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a> tag;
               </li>
               <li>Large reference sections describing all the elements and attributes. (This part of
                   the Tag Library provides individual definitions and tagged examples for most of
                   the elements and attributes used in the Tag Set.);
               </li>
               <li>Tree-like hierarchical diagrams that show the structures in the Authoring Tag Set; and </li>
               <li>A full article sample, which has been tagged as an XML file valid to this Tag Set.</li>
            </ul> Implementor-level material is also included:
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>A separate reference section describing the Parameter Entities;</li>
               <li>An introduction to the design principles for the whole modular
                   Archiving and Interchange Suite from which this Tag Set was constructed;
               </li>
               <li>An explanation of how to build new DTDs from the modules in the
                    Suite;
               </li>
               <li>Tables and appendices useful for reference on the fine points
                   of the Tag Set (such as naming conventions); and 
               </li>
               <li>Reading copies of the DTD modules of the Article Authoring DTD as well as the modules that make up the full modular Suite.</li>

               <p class="para">This Authoring Tag Set is an XML vocabulary designed to describe new journal articles. These tags can be used by authors to
                  submit publications to journals and to archives such as PubMed Central. The focus on authoring means that this is a smaller,
                  tighter, less inclusive tag set than would have been necessary to create a journal <em>archiving</em> tag set. An archiving tag set needs to accommodate a wide variety of structures and offers very flexible content models for
                  elements, whereas this Authoring Tag Set is more prescriptive than descriptive and includes many elements whose content must
                  occur in a specified order. This is a tag set optimized for authorship of new journal articles, where regularization and control
                  of content is important, and where it is useful rather than harmful to have only one way to tag a structure.
               </p>
               <p class="para">Since no assumptions can be made concerning the processing software and editorial situation that will receive an article authored
                  in this Tag Set, tagging that forces specific formatting has been avoided. There is no way for an author to number his/her
                  lists explicitly, for example, or to manually number the cited references, since many journals have their own citation policies.
                  Numbers for the cited references must be generated by software to match editorial policy. For proofing purposes, the stlyesheets
                  that may be used to produce PDF from these tagged articles number the references as counting numbers and the stylesheets that
                  produce HTML for proofing display the identifier of the <a href="n-cxu0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;ref&gt;</span></a> as the number.

               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li><em>Articles</em>. This is not a Tag Set for complete journals. The Authoring Tag Set models journal articles, where such an article is defined
                     as the typical research article found in an STM journal. By design, the definition of an article is broad enough to include
                     other article-like material found in journals, for example, editorials, short new pieces, obituaries, meeting reports, and
                     book or product reviews. 
                  </li>
                  <li><em>Header and Body</em>. This Tag Set describes both the metadata for a journal article and the content of the article. Both are required to make
                     a complete article.
                  </li>
                  <li><em>Multidisciplinary</em>.  Although designed for biomedical journals, this Tag Set should be sufficiently general to describe not only STM journals
                     but technical journals in any field.

               <p class="para">
                                Version 2.3 was an enhancement release that made changes requested by the Working Group based on operational
                  concerns. All changes to content models and attribute lists have been made backward compatible. As an example, a new XHTML
                  &#8220;style&#8221; attribute was added to all the elements inside &lt;table&gt; and the  &#8220;content-type&#8221; attribute was distributed widely to

               <p class="para">Because access for a wide range of output devices, as well as for
                         the visually impaired, is becoming more and more important in the STM journal
                         community, the modules in the Archiving and Interchange Suite were designed to follow, as much as
                         possible, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/"><span class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                               2.0</span></a> working draft.  This Tag Set is based on the Archiving and Interchange Suite, which used the August 2002 specification, which
                  was the latest accessibility specification
                         available when the Suite was initially constructed. This Specification specifies
                         accessibility guidelines on many levels from design through application. The
                         guidelines which pertain to the modeling of materials were followed to at least
                         Level-2 compliance. For example, a <a href="n-xh80.html"><span class="elementname">Long Description</span></a>
                         <a href="n-xh80.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;long-desc&gt;</span></a> element was defined as part of many
                         other elements, such as <a href="n-zs50.html"><span class="elementname">Figure</span></a> <a href="n-zs50.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;fig&gt;</span></a>, so it can be added not only to all figures and other graphical objects, but to any section of the text (for example, to
                  a <a href="n-puc0.html"><span class="elementname">Boxed Text</span></a> <a href="n-puc0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;boxed-text&gt;</span></a>) to provide an accessible description of the object. The <a href="n-ec70.html"><span class="attrtag">xml:lang</span></a> attribute was added to all
                         section-level elements and many paragraph-level elements to permit explicit
                         indication of the language of the content, as required by these guidelines. The <a href="n-7320.html"><span class="elementname">Abbreviation or Acronym</span></a> <a href="n-7320.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;abbrev&gt;</span></a> element (also to be used for acronyms) was added to meet Checkpoint 4.3.
