         <h2 class="header">Definition</h2>
         <p class="para">Indicates what kind of article this is, for example, a research
                    article, a commentary, a book or product review, a case report, a calendar,
                    etc. This is  a prescribed list of values that can be checked by XML parsers.

      <h2 class="header">Usage</h2>
      <p class="para">This attribute can be used to attach information classes to articles for grouping or searching. For best practice, all articles
         should be assigned types if possible. If the article
                is not one of the listed types or the type of article cannot be determined, the
                &#8220;<tt>other</tt>&#8221; attribute value may be
                used, or the attribute may be omitted.
      </p>
      <p class="para"><strong>Use for primary article</strong> &#8212; When the article is a commentary on another article (for example,
                a correction or addendum), this attribute contains metadata concerning the commentary itself;
                it does <em>not</em> define the kind of article that is being corrected or
                amended.

         <h2 class="header">Remarks</h2>
         <p class="para">When possible, this attribute should used on the <a href="n-3r20.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a> element to provide typing information for retrieval or record keeping.
