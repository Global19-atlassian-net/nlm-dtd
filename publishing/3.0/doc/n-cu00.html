         <p class="para">The intent of the NLM Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite is to provide a common format in which publishers and archives
            can exchange journal content. The Suite provides a set of XML schema modules that define elements and attributes for describing
            the textual and graphical content of journal articles as well as some non-article material such as letters, editorials, and
            book and product reviews.

            <div class="section"><a name="rationale"></a><h4 class="header">Rationale</h4>
               <p class="para">The Journal Publishing Tag Set defines elements and attributes that describe the content and metadata of journal articles,
                  including research and non-research articles, letters, editorials, and book and product reviews. The Tag Set allows for descriptions
                  of the full article content or just the article header metadata.
               </p>
               <p class="para">Publishing is a moderately prescriptive Tag Set, optimized for archives who wish to regularize and control their content,
                  not to accept the sequence and arrangement presented to them by any particular publisher. The Tag Set is also intended for
                  use by publishers for the initial XML tagging of journal material, usually as converted from an authoring form like Microsoft
                  Word.
               </p>
               <p class="para">Because Publishing is optimized for regularizing an archive or establishing a sequence of elements to aid print and web production,
                  the Tag Set is smaller than the Archiving Tag Set. There are fewer elements, fewer choices in many contexts, and particular
                  element sequence is imposed more often.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The philosophy of this Publishing Tag Set is to prefer a single structural form whenever possible. The Publishing Tag Set
                  is optimized for regularizing an archive or establishing a sequence of elements to aid print and web production. Elements
                  and tagging choices are limited to produce consistent data structures to enable output products and to provide a single location
                  of information for searching.

               <p class="para">By design, this is a model for journal articles, such as the typical research article found in an STM journal, and not a model
                  for complete journals. This Tag Set does not include an overarching model for a collection of articles. In addition, the following
                  journal material is not described by this Tag Set:
                  
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>Company, product, or service display advertising;</li>
                     <li>Job search or classified advertising;</li>
                     <li>Calendars, meeting schedules, and conference announcements (except as these can be tagged as ordinary articles, sub-articles,
                        or sections within articles); and
                     </li>
                     <li>Material specific to an individual journal, such as Author Guidelines, Policy and Scope statements, editorial or advisory
                        boards, detailed indicia, etc.
                     </li>
                  </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="section"><a name="overview"></a><h4 class="header">Structural Overview</h4>
               <p class="para">The Journal Publishing Tag Set defines a document that is a top-level component of a journal such as an article, a book or
                  product review, or a letter to the editor. Each such document is composed of one or more parts; if there is more than one
                  part, they must appear in the following order:
               </p>
               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li>Front matter (required). The article front matter contains the metadata for the article (also called article header information),
                     for example, the article title, the journal in which it appears, the date and issue of publication for that issue of that
                     journal, a copyright statement, etc. This is not textual front matter as appears in books, rather this is bibliographic information
                     about the article and the journal in which it was published.
                  </li>
                  <li>Body of the article (optional). The body of the article is the main textual and graphic content of the article. This usually
                     consists of paragraphs and sections, which may themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars (boxed text), etc. The body of
                     the article is optional to accommodate those repositories that just keep article header information and do not tag the textual
                     content.
                  </li>
                  <li>Back matter for the article (optional). If present, the article back matter contains information that is ancillary to the
                     main text, such as a glossary, appendix, or list of cited references.
                  </li>
                  <li>Floating Material (optional). A publisher may choose to place all the floating objects in an article and its back matter (such
                     as tables, figures, boxed text sidebars, etc.) into a separate container element outside the narrative flow for convenience
                     of processing.
                  </li>
                  <li>Following the front, body, back, and floating material, there may be either one or more responses to the article or one or
                     more subordinate articles:
                     
                     <ul class="bullist">
                        <li>Response. A response is a commentary on the article itself, for example, an opinion from an editor on the importance of the
                           article or a reply from the original author to a letter concerning his article.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sub-article. A sub-article is a small article that is completely contained inside another article.</li>
                     </ul>

            <div class="section"><a name="accessibility"></a><h4 class="header">Accessibility</h4>
               <p class="para">Because access for a wide range of output devices, as well as for the visually impaired, is becoming more and more important
                  in the STM journal community, the modules in the Archiving and Interchange Suite were designed to follow, as much as possible,
                  the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/"><span class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</span></a> working draft (22 August 2002), which was the latest accessibility specification available when the Suite was initially constructed.
                  This Specification specifies accessibility guidelines on many levels from design through application. The guidelines which
                  pertain to the modeling of materials were followed to at least Level-2 compliance. For example, a <a href="n-yhx0.html" target="main" title="<long-desc&gt;"><span class="elementname">Long Description</span></a> <a href="n-yhx0.html" target="main" title="Long Description"><span class="elementtag">&lt;long-desc&gt;</span></a> element was defined as part of many other elements, such as <a href="n-kza0.html" target="main" title="<fig&gt;"><span class="elementname">Figure</span></a> <a href="n-kza0.html" target="main" title="Figure"><span class="elementtag">&lt;fig&gt;</span></a>, so it can be added not only to all figures and other graphical objects, but to any section of the text (for example, to
                  a <a href="n-8w30.html" target="main" title="<boxed-text&gt;"><span class="elementname">Boxed Text</span></a> <a href="n-8w30.html" target="main" title="Boxed Text"><span class="elementtag">&lt;boxed-text&gt;</span></a>) to provide an accessible description of the object. The <a href="n-6qy0.html" target="main" title="Language"><span class="attrtag">@xml:lang</span></a> attribute was added to all section-level elements and many paragraph-level elements to permit explicit indication of the
                  language of the content, as required by these guidelines. The <a href="n-xn00.html" target="main" title="<abbrev&gt;"><span class="elementname">Abbreviation or Acronym</span></a> <a href="n-xn00.html" target="main" title="Abbreviation or Acronym"><span class="elementtag">&lt;abbrev&gt;</span></a> element (also to be used for acronyms) was added to meet Checkpoint 4.3.

            <p class="para">This version of the Tag Suite and the derivative Tag Sets marks a significant departure from all previous versions. Before
               now, all changes to the Suite had been fully backward compatible. That meant that while the Suite changed and grew, no document
               tagged according to a particular Tag Set was invalid because of any new or changed models. For the first time, this is not
               the case. Version 3.0 is non-backward compatible, meaning documents which were valid against any previous version may not
               be valid against this version. Some users will choose to keep their existing documents as they are, valid according to an
               older version of the Tag Set and to use the new Tag Set for future documents. Some users will convert their existing documents
               to the new Tag Set, a conversion that we believe will be mostly automatable in most cases. It is possible that some users
               will choose to continue to use an older version of the Tag Set.
            </p>
            <p class="para">The rationales behind the changes vary, but all were made with the intent to make it easier to move forward. There has been
               nearly six years of experience working with this Tag Set on journal articles as varied as medicine, biotechnology, and physics.
               Many of the changes were of the “if we had known then what we know now” variety. Others were changes that have been obvious
               improvements for four or five years, but could not be made within the scope of normal maintenance because they would have
               been non-backward compatible.
            </p>
            <p class="para">Version 3.0 includes the regular scope changes and additions that have been the subject of previous version releases. For
               example, a new funding model (<a href="n-yru0.html" target="main" title="Funding Group"><span class="elementtag">&lt;funding-group&gt;</span></a>) has been added to reflect the changing needs of the community. In addition to this kind of change, version 3.0 changes also
               include:
               
               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li>Elements renamed to make the naming more consistent throughout the Tag Suite. For example, the element <tt>&lt;custom-meta-wrap&gt;</tt> was changed to <a href="n-5s80.html" target="main" title="Custom Metadata Group"><span class="elementtag">&lt;custom-meta-group&gt;</span></a> because it was learned over the years that “wraps” represent a single element and all its component parts while “groups”
                     are collections of similar objects.
                  </li>
                  <li>Confusing or ambiguous aspects of the models were simplified. For example, the “<tt>citation-type</tt>” attribute on bibliographic reference citations used to be a text attribute that gave the “type” of the citation. This attribute
                     was used to specify that this was a journal, not a book; or that this was a print, not a web publication; or that this was
                     published by the government or by a standards body. Use of this “type” attribute got very confusing when a user wanted to
                     specify several things about a document (a report published online by the government). This single, over-used attribute was
                     replaced with three new, more specific attributes: <a href="n-u8i0.html" target="main" title="Type of Publication"><span class="attrtag">@publication-type</span></a> (to hold journal or book), <a href="n-x5i0.html" target="main" title="Publication Format"><span class="attrtag">@publication-format</span></a> (to hold print versus online), and <a href="n-8ai0.html" target="main" title="Type of Publisher"><span class="attrtag">@publisher-type</span></a> (to hold standards body versus government).
                  </li>
                  <li>Wrapper elements were added to keep related-material together. For example, translated titles and subtitles are now tied together
                     in a <a href="n-gk60.html" target="main" title="Translated Title Group"><span class="elementtag">&lt;trans-title-group&gt;</span></a> element, which holds the <a href="n-6qy0.html" target="main" title="Language"><span class="attrtag">@xml:lang</span></a> attribute previously held by individual titles and subtitles.
                  </li>
               </ul>
