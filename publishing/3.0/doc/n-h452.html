         <h4 class="header">Audience or Use Alternatives</h4>
         <p class="para">The <a href="n-g520.html" target="main" title="Alternatives For Processing"><span class="elementtag">&lt;alternatives&gt;</span></a> element names processing alternatives for a single display object such as a graphic or a table. It does not, however, accommodate
            versions of semantically equivalent material intended for different audiences (for patients versus for doctors). Typical cases
            of this type of multiple version include: 
         </p>
         <ul class="bullist">
            <li>Two versions of a section, a short one for print to save paper and a significantly longer one for online display;</li>
            <li>A paragraph that is only in the online version and not the in print version of the same article;</li>
            <li>Two or more versions of a section of semantically equivalent material prepared at different levels for different audiences
               (top secret versus secret versus publicly disseminated or doctor/nurses/patients);  or
            </li>
            <li>Alternative versions of a <a href="n-8w30.html" target="main" title="Boxed Text"><span class="elementtag">&lt;boxed-text&gt;</span></a> for different print products (one for the magazine and one for the journal).
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="para">These textual/semantic alternatives are very different from the case of multiple formats of the same graphic, in part because
            there is a structural difference; a given section does or does not contain this paragraph. The is also a slight difference
            in complexity between this case and that of the graphic in that, for the multiple formats graphic, software picks one alternative
            and, for the structure, the software must build a different structural tree. While this Tag Suite does not support alternate
            trees, it does include an attribute (<a href="n-vky0.html" target="main" title="Specific Use"><span class="attrtag">@specific-use</span></a>) to record these distinctions.
         </p>
         <p class="para">The <a href="n-vky0.html" target="main" title="Specific Use"><span class="attrtag">@specific-use</span></a> could be used to record that certain paragraphs were for print-only:
         </p>
         <div class="codeblock"><pre>
   &lt;p specific-use="print-only"&gt;See the latest updates on our website:
   http://www.mulberrytech.com&lt;/p&gt;
</pre></div>
         <p class="para">The <a href="n-vky0.html" target="main" title="Specific Use"><span class="attrtag">@specific-use</span></a> attribute can be placed on all the block-level structures, that is, on paragraphs, figures, sections, and all the block display
            objects. There is no recommended set of values, but publishers have used  “print-only”, “web-only”. “online-only”, “voice-only”,
            “specific-product-name”, etc.
