THIS SCHEMA IS NOT INTENDED FOR MAINTENANCE. This Schema has been generated out of a flattened rendition of the corresponding NCBI DTD. While the structural constraints on document tagging expressed by this schema are identical to those of the DTD, the DTD's modular architecture is not reflected in the schema's organization. Changes to the schema must therefore be made by making the analogous changes to the DTD, and regenerating a schema from the modified DTD.

The Schema has been tested and found to perform properly in James Clark's Jing Validator running in syncROsoft oXygen (version 7.1).
