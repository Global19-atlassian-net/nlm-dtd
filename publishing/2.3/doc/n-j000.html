         <p class="para">The Journal Publishing Tag Set defines elements and attributes that describe the content of journal articles, as well as some
            non-article material found in journals, such as letters, editorials, and book and product reviews. This Tag Set was written
            to describe both the metadata for a journal article and the content of the article, but it can also be used to describe only
            the article header metadata. This is a moderately prescriptive tag set, optimized for the archives who wish to regularize
            and control their content as well as for some publishers to use for initial XML tagging of journal material. Although designed
            for biomedical journals, this tag set should be sufficiently general to describe not only STM journals but technical journals
            in any field.
         </p>
         <p class="para">The Journal Publishing Document Type Definition (DTD) is the foundational constraint language for the tag set. The DTD comprises
            a few Publishing-DTD-specific modules and uses (by reference) the base modules of the Journal Archiving and Interchange Suite.
            The modules of that Suite were developed as part of an effort to create XML applications through which materials on health-related
            disciplines could be shared and reused electronically. The Suite can be (and has been) used to construct many tag sets in
            addition to this one. Although the full Suite was developed to support electronic production, the structures should be adequate
            to support some print production as well. 
            
         </p>
         <p class="para">
            Since this is a Publishing Tag Set optimized for regularizing an archive, rather than a strict preservationist tag set, the
            tag set is far smaller (with fewer elements and fewer choices in many contexts) than is the full Journal Archiving and Interchange
            Tag Set. Where, in the Archiving Tag Set, there are several ways to express the same information, the goal for Publishing
            was to allow only one way to tag the same content. It was not the intention to limit the expressive power licensed by this
            tag set, but rather to limit the meaningless choices that a full interchange tag set needs to make to accommodate conversion
            from as wide a variety of formats as possible. The philosophy for the Archiving Tag Set was to accept as many varied forms
            of many structures as possible unchanged. The philosophy for the Publishing Tag Set was to accept a wide variety of structures
            and to regularize those that matter to the archive.

            <p class="para">
               Version 2.3 was an enhancement release that made changes requested by the Working Group based on operational concerns. All
               changes to content models and attribute lists have been made backward compatible. As an example, a new XHTML &#8220;style&#8221; attribute
               was added to all the elements inside <a href="n-3ns0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;table&gt;</span></a> and the  &#8220;content-type&#8221; attribute was distributed widely to add or preserve semantic information. The Publishing 2.3 Change

            <div class="section"><a name="purpose"></a><h2 class="header">Purpose: Preservation of Intellectual Content</h2>
               <p class="para"> The intent of this Publishing Tag Set is to &#8220;preserve the
                   intellectual content of journals independent of the form in which that content
                   was originally delivered&#8221;. The tags defined here will be used to describe
                   journal articles that originate with many publishers and societies but whose
                   content will be stored in repositories such as the NLM PubMed Central repository. Therefore,
                   the Suite has been optimized for conversion from a variety of journal source
                   Tag Sets, with the intent of providing a single format in which publishers can
                   deliver their content to a wide range of archives. There are so many journal
                   Tag Sets currently in use by publishers, repositories, content-aggregators,
                   scientific societies, and compositors that this tag set cannot possibly
                   incorporate all the variation to be found in such diverse models. But a wide
                   variety of structures can be accommodated, since the content models for the
                   elements have been made very flexible, including a wide range of elements with
                   nearly all content structures optional.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The conversion focus also means that this is a larger, more
                   inclusive Tag Set than might have been necessary if the intent had been, for
                   example, to create only a journal <em>authoring</em> Tag Set. Many elements have been
                   created explicitly so that information tagged by publishers would not be
                   discarded when they converted material from another Tag Set to this tag set. Because of the broad
                   scope of the several proposed electronic archives, this tag set contains elements
                   and attributes that may only occur in a very few journals. Care has been
                   taken to provide several mechanisms (frequently, information classing
                   attributes) to preserve the intellectual content of a document structure when
                   that structure is converted from another DTD or schema to this one, even if
                   there is no exact element equivalent of the structure.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The exact replication of the look and feel of any particular
                   journal has not been a consideration. Therefore, many purely formatting
                   mechanisms have not been included.

               <p class="para">Although the entire Suite aims at much broader application, this Journal Publishing Tag Set models journal articles, where
                  a journal article is defined as the typical research article found in an STM journal. By design, the definition of an article
                  also includes some article-like material
                   found in journals, for example, letters, editorials, short new pieces, obituaries, meeting reports, and book and product
                  reviews.
               </p>
               <p class="para">By design, this is a model for journal articles, not for complete journals. Thus, there is no overarching model for a collection
                  of articles. In addition, the following journal material has not been described by this Publishing Tag Set:
                  <ul class="bullist">

                         these can be handled as ordinary articles or sections within articles); and
                     </li>
                     <li>Material specific to an individual journal, such as Author Guidelines, Policy and Scope statements, Editorial or advisory

               <p class="para">The Journal Publishing Tag Set defines a document that is a top-level component of a journal such as an article, a book or
                  product review, or a letter to the editor. Each
                   such document is composed of one or more parts; if there is more than one part, they must appear in the
                   following order:
                   
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>Front matter (required). The article front matter contains
                         the metadata for the article (also called article header information), for example,  the article title, the journal in which
                        it appears, the date and issue of publication for that issue of that journal, a copyright statement, etc. This is not textual
                        front matter as in books, this is bibliographic information about the article and the journal in which it was published.
                     </li>
                     <li>Body of the article (optional). The body of the article is
                         the main textual and graphic content of the article. This usually consists of
                         paragraphs and sections, which may themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars
                         (boxed text), etc. The body of the article is optional to accommodate those repositories that just keep article header information
                        and do not tag the textual content.
                     </li>
                     <li>Back matter for the article (optional). If present,
                         the article back matter contains information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary,
                         appendix, or list of cited references.
                     </li>
                     <li>Floating Material (optional). A publisher may choose to place all the floating objects in an article and its back matter (such
                        as tables, figures, boxed text sidebars, etc.) into a separate container element outside the narrative flow for convenience
                        of processing.
                     </li>
                     <li>Following the front, body, back,  and (optional) floating material, there may be either one or more responses to the article
                        or one or more
                         subordinate articles:
                        <ul class="bullist">
                           <li>Response (rarely used). A response is a commentary on
                               the article itself, for example, an opinion from an editor on the importance of
                               the article or a reply from the original author to a letter concerning his
                               article.

                           <li>Sub-article (rarely used). A sub-article is a small
                               article that is completely contained inside another article.

               <p class="para">Both this Publishing DTD and the full Archiving and Interchange Suite have been written as a set of XML DTD &#8220;modules&#8221;, each
                  of which is a separate physical file. No module
                   is an entire DTD by itself, but these modules can be combined into a number of
                   different DTDs. Modules are primarily intended for maintenance; all
                   the elements of the same &#8220;type&#8221; (class) are stored together.
                   
               </p>
               <p class="para">This Journal Publishing DTD has been built from these modules, and both this DTD and
                   individual modules from the Archival and Interchange Suite will be described in this Tag Library.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The major disadvantage of a modular system is the longer learning
                   curve, since it may not be immediately obvious <em>where</em>
                   within the system to find a particular element or attribute cluster. To help
                   with this, the description of each element in the Element Section of this
                   documentation names the module in which that element is defined.
               </p>
               <p class="para">There are many advantages to such a modular approach. The smaller
                   units are written once, maintained in one place, and used in many different
                   DTDs. This makes it much easier to keep lower level structures consistent
                   across document types, while allowing for any real differences that analysis
                   identifies. A DTD for a new function (such as an authoring DTD) or a new
                   publication type can be built quickly, since most of the necessary components
                   will already be defined in the Suite. Editorial and production personnel
                   can bring the experience gained on one tagging project directly to the next
                   with very little loss or retraining. Customized software (including authoring,
                   typesetting, and electronic display tools) can be written once, shared among
                   projects, and modified only for real distinctions.

                        been designed to be open and
                         inclusive, to allow journal articles to be translated from a wide variety of
                         proprietary journal article DTDs and schemas. It is permissive by design, intended to capture whatever warts and wrinkles
                        exist in Publishers&#8217; content.

                     <li>Journal Publishing Tag Set (Publishing) &#8212; A public Tag Set for use as a repository tag set by archives which desire consistent
                        processing and searching capability. The Publishing Tag Set is a more prescriptive and restrictive subset of the Journal Archiving
                        and Interchange Suite than the Journal Archiving Tag Set (above). This Tag Set may also be used to transfer content between
                        archives or as a base tag set for Publishers.
                     </li>
                     <li>Article Authoring Tag Set (Authoring) &#8212; A public Tag Set intended for writing and editing <em>new</em> journal articles. The Authoring Tag Set has been  designed to enable &#8220;good&#8221; journal coding and to provide assistance to authors
                        and editors through more restricted models than the interchange and repository tag sets allow.

                     <li>NCBI Book, Book Collection, and Historical Book Tag Sets &#8212; The NCBI Book Tag Set defines elements and attributes that describe
                        the content of books such as pamphlets and monographs. The NCBI Book Collection Tag Set describes a document that contains
                        metadata for a grouping or &#8220;collection&#8221; of books, potentially followed by textual information about the books in the collection,
                        and a listing of the books; the content of the books is not included. The NCBI Historical Book Tag Set  is a layer on top
                        of the NCBI Book Tag Set  specifically
                           designed to describe historical materials by adding structures relevant to the digitization of historical works, for example
                        metadata concerning the digital edition. The three  NCBI book tag sets were written to specific NCBI book requirements and
                        are therefore not generic book tag sets in the same way that all the journal article tag sets are generic.

               <p class="para">Because access for a wide range of output devices, as well as for
                         the visually impaired, is becoming more and more important in the STM journal
                         community, the modules in the Archiving and Interchange Suite were designed to follow, as much as
                         possible, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/"><span class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                               2.0</span></a> working draft (22 August 2002), which was the latest accessibility specification
                         available when the Suite was initially constructed. This Specification specifies
                         accessibility guidelines on many levels from design through application. The
                         guidelines which pertain to the modeling of materials were followed to at least
                         Level-2 compliance. For example, a <a href="n-ehu0.html"><span class="elementname">Long Description</span></a>
                         <a href="n-ehu0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;long-desc&gt;</span></a> element was defined as part of many
                         other elements, such as <a href="n-si80.html"><span class="elementname">Figure</span></a> <a href="n-si80.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;fig&gt;</span></a>, so it can be added
                         not only to all figures and other graphical objects, but to any section of the
                         text (for example, to a <a href="n-5qc0.html"><span class="elementname">Boxed Text</span></a> <a href="n-5qc0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;boxed-text&gt;</span></a>) to
                         provide an accessible description of the object. The
                         <a href="n-9260.html"><span class="attrtag">xml:lang</span></a> attribute was added to all
                         section-level elements and many paragraph-level elements to permit explicit
                         indication of the language of the content, as required by these guidelines. The <a href="n-cm00.html"><span class="elementname">Abbreviation or Acronym</span></a> <a href="n-cm00.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;abbrev&gt;</span></a> element (also to be used for acronyms) was added to meet Checkpoint 4.3.

                         physical files that, taken together, define all element structures (such as
                         tables, math, chemistry, paragraphs, sections, figures, footnotes, and
                         reference elements), as well as attributes and entities in the Suite.
               </p>
               <p class="para">Modules in the Suite are primarily intended to group elements for maintenance.
                         There are different kinds of modules. A module may either:
                         
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>Be a building block for a base DTD (such as the <a href="n-ffi0.html"><span class="pename">Module to Name the Modules</span></a> module)
                     </li>
                     <li>Define the elements inside a particular structure. For
                                   example, the <a href="n-v4y0.html"><span class="pename">Bibliography References (Citation) Elements Module</span></a> module names all the potential components of
                                   bibliographic reference lists.
                     </li>
                     <li>Name the members of a &#8220;class&#8221; of elements,
                                   where class is a named <br class="br">grouping of elements that share a similar usage or
                                   potential location. For example, the <a href="n-uky0.html"><span class="pename">Phrase-Level Content Elements Module</span></a> module defines small floating
                                   elements that may occur within text, such as inside a paragraph or a title, or
                                   that describe textual content, for example, a disease name, drug name, or the
                                   name of a discipline.

               <p class="para">Parameter Entities are the
                         major mechanism for customizing a DTD or creating a new DTD from the modules in
                         the Suite. Individual DTDs will be constructed by 1) establishing element and
                         attribute combinations and content models using Parameter Entities in one of the DTD-specific customizing modules and
                  2) choosing appropriate modules from the Suite that declare the elements needed.
                         For example, if the base DTD contained 6 kinds of lists
                         and 2 table models, a more specific DTD, such as an authoring DTD, might use a
                         Customize Classes Module to redefine the List Class to name only 3 lists and
                         redefine the Display Class to allow only one table model.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The standard modules to create a customized DTD are: the DTD itself, a module to name its components, and as many over-ride
                  modules and new elements modules as necessary. Typical modules for a new DTD are:
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>DTD &#8212; The DTD module (<tt>.dtd</tt>) for the new DTD base DTD (At a minimum, this module declares the top-level element (such as article, book, or report) and
                        any other structural elements
                                   unique to the new document type.)
                     </li>
                     <li>DTD-specific Module of Modules &#8212; The DTD-specific module of modules, to name all the new modules created expressly for the

                     </li>
                     <li>New Models &#8212; DTD-specific new elements (for example, a new Book DTD might add book-specific metadata elements)</li>

               <p class="para">Many of the elements in the Journal Publishing DTD have been
                         grouped into loose element classes. There is no hard and fast rule for what constitutes a class; each one is a design
                  decision, a matter of judgment. These classes are designed to ease customization to meet the particular needs of new DTDs.
                  Base classes for the Archiving and Interchange Suite are defined in a separate <a href="n-jxr0.html"><span class="pename">Default Element Classes Module</span></a> (<a href="n-jxr0.html"><span class="petag">%default-classes.ent;</span></a>).

                         <em>data characters</em> and any of the elements named in the <a href="n-jji0.html"><span class="pename">Paragraph Elements</span></a> mix. The mix <a href="n-jji0.html"><span class="petag">%p-elements;</span></a> is
                         declared to be a large OR group of many other element-defining classes: the <a href="n-e5d0.html"><span class="pename">Block Display Class Elements</span></a>, the
                         <a href="n-jvi0.html"><span class="pename">Mathematical Expressions Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-twi0.html"><span class="pename">List Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-9sd0.html"><span class="pename">Citation Class Elements</span></a>, et al.
               </p>
               <p class="para">These element classes can be viewed as building blocks that will
                         be used to build larger Parameter Entities for element mixes. (Note: A mix describes a
                         usage circumstance for a group of elements, such as all the paragraph-level
                         elements, all the elements allowed inside a table cell, all the elements inside
                         a paragraph, or all the inline elements). For example, to add another block display item to the <a href="n-e5d0.html"><span class="pename">Block Display Class Elements</span></a>, you
                         would edit the <a href="n-e5d0.html"><span class="petag">%block-display.class;</span></a> Parameter Entity in the
                         DTD-specific Journal Publishing Class Over-ride Module to override the default Parameter Entity in the Suite&#8217;s <a href="n-jxr0.html"><span class="pename">Default Element Classes Module</span></a> module and create a new module containing the Element Declaration of the new block display item.

                  <p class="para">The basic idea for a new DTD is that all lower-level elements (paragraphs, lists,

                     in the DTD itself. The new DTD
                     will be fairly short and include only definitions of the topmost elements, at least the document element and maybe its children.

                  <p class="para">To show the process, here is a series of instructions for making a new DTD, illustrated by showing how the Journal Publishing
                     DTD was created from the modules of the whole Suite.
                     <ol class="olist">
                        <li><strong>Modules</strong> &#8212; Write a new DTD-specific Module of Modules, which defines all new customization modules the DTD needs. (As an example,
                            the Journal Publishing DTD created the module <tt>%journalpubcustom-modules.ent;</tt>, which contains the definitions of the class-over-ride module <tt>%journalpubcustom-classes.ent;</tt>, the mix-over-ride module <tt>%journalpubcustom-mixes.ent;</tt>, and the models-over-ride module <tt>%journalpubcustom-models.ent;</tt>.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Class Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Write a DTD-specific class-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the Suite classes. These classes are defined in the default classes module, <tt>%default-classes.ent;</tt>.  (As an example,  the Journal Publishing DTD created the module <tt>%journalpubcustom-classes.ent;</tt>, in which several new models, including <tt>%rest-of-para.class.class;</tt> and <tt>%sec-back.class;</tt>, were declared.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mix Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Write a DTD-specific mix-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the Suite mixes. These mixes are defined in the default mixes module, <tt>%default-mixes.ent;</tt>.  (As an example,  the Journal Publishing DTD created the module <tt>%journalpubcustom-mixes.ent;</tt>, in which mixes such as <tt>%emphasized-text;</tt> and <tt>%simple-phrase;</tt> were declared.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Model Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Create a DTD-specific content-model-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the  content models and
                           attribute lists for the Suite. (As an example, the Journal Publishing DTD created the module <tt>%journalpubcustom-models.ent;</tt>, in which element collections (suffixed &#8220;<tt>-elements</tt>&#8221;) that will be mixed with <tt>#PCDATA</tt> were redefined, full content models over-rides (suffixed &#8220;<tt>-model</tt>&#8221;) were redefined, and some new attributes and attribute lists were added.) 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>New Elements</strong> &#8212; Write any new element modules needed. These will define any new block-level or phrase-level elements. (As an example, the
                           Journal Publishing DTD created the module <tt>%nlmcitation.ent;</tt>, in which a more prescriptive citation element, <a href="n-tgw0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;nlm-citation&gt;</span></a>, was declared. This module was later adopted by the Base Suite.)

                        <li><strong>DTD Module</strong> &#8212; With those modules in place, construct a new DTD module. Within that module:

                              <li>Use an External Parameter Entity reference to call any new DTD-specific module defining new block-level or phrase-level elements.
                                 (For the Journal Publishing DTD, the module <tt>%nlmcitation.ent;</tt> in which a more prescriptive citation element, <a href="n-tgw0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;nlm-citation&gt;</span></a>, was declared)

                                 order, since the order does not matter.)

                              <li>Define the document element and any other unique
                                 elements and entities needed for this DTD. (For example, the Journal Publishing DTD declares only a few elements &#8212; &#8212; <a href="n-4920.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a>  [the top-level element] and its potential components:  <a href="n-u8a0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;front&gt;</span></a>, <a href="n-96c0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;body&gt;</span></a>, <a href="n-hfc0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;back&gt;</span></a>, <a href="n-sm80.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;floats-wrap&gt;</span></a>,  <a href="n-jp40.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;sub-article&gt;</span></a>, and <a href="n-27v0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;response&gt;</span></a>.)

                  documents tagged according to this Suite would be to limit the names and path names to these characters: letters (both upper
                  and lower case), numbers, underscore, hyphen, and period. All such names will be assumed to be case sensitive. DOS-style file
                  extensions may be used.
