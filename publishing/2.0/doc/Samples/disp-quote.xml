<p>It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily
and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, the slightest variations;
rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are
good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity
offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its
organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow
changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the lapse of
ages.</p>
