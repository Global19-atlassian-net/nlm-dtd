<title>Comment Letter 1</title>
<p>Arthur et al. reported an interesting case of human keratouveitis 
associated with the intraocular long-term retention of a contact lens, 
<?mtl hellip?>in which a filamentous fungus and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> 
were involved (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In spite of no 
antifungal drug being administered, the infection was resolved. Histological 
examination revealed the presence of fungal elements in the tissue around 
the lens.</p>
<p>The fungus involved in such infection was identified by the authors as 
<italic>Scedosporium prolificans</italic> (<xref rid="R1" 
ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), an emerging hyphomycete which causes severe 
infections, mainly in immunocompromised patients 
(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, it was described as 
having &ldquo;flask-shaped conidiogenous cells with elongated necks and 
individual conidia as well as chains&hellip;&rdquo; 
(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). <italic>Scedosporium 
prolificans</italic> is indeed characterized by flask-shaped conidiogenous 
cells, often in brush-like arrangement, not single on hyphae as depicted in 
Fig. 2 of the mentioned article, and by its ovoid conidia in slimy heads, 
never in chains. This last feature is useful to the nonexperienced mycologists 
for distinguishing this species from other morphologically similar fungi such 
as <italic>Scopulariopsis</italic> spp. Some species of <italic>Scopulariopsis</italic> 
show dark colonies and also dark conidia, which arise from annellidic 
conidiogenous cells, forming dry, basipetal chains. However, the fungus 
shown in Fig. 2 does not seem to be a species of <italic>Scopulariopsis</italic>,
because in this genus single conidiogenous cells are not common. They are mainly 
in branched and sometimes penicillated conidiophores. Furthermore, conidia of 
<italic>Scopulariopsis</italic> spp. are more or less spherical and usually with 
a wide truncate base, while those of Fig. 2 seem to be fusiform or 
lemon-shaped.</p>
<p>It is difficult, merely by observing the mentioned figure, to ascertain 
the species to which the fungus belongs. However, the images are reminiscent 
of <italic>Acrophialophora fusispora</italic>, which has been recovered recently 
in several clinical cases. Its colonies are greyish brown, and the conidia are 
pale brown. An important distinctive feature of this species is the ornamentation of the conidia, which is finely echinulate and often with distinct spiral bands. <italic>Acremonium</italic> sp. could be another possibility due to the presence of single conidiogenous cells (phialides) emerging from ropes of vegetative hyphae (Fig. 2B), which is typical of this genus, although dark colonies are rarely produced.</p>
<p>To provide figures of a fungus involved in a reported case, even if the 
species is common, constitutes a good practice. This allows readers to agree, 
or not as in this case, with the identification of species involved. We would 
like to encourage the authors to deposit cultures of clinical isolates in an 
international culture collection, from where it could then be obtained by 
interested people for further studies. Without the availability of the isolates, 
the published etiology is of low value (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).

<p>We are writing concerning the identification of the fungus causing 
keratouveitis <?mtl hellip?>recently reported by S. Arthur, L. L. Steed, D. J. Apple, 
Q. Peng, G. Howard, and M. Escobar-Gomez in J. Clin. Microbiol. 39:4579-4582 
(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The fungus was identified as 
<italic>Scedosporium prolificans</italic>, but the figures and text 
description of the fungus do not match this species. <italic>S. prolificans</italic> 
has dark gray colonies, and conidia are not produced in chains 
(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The text describes the fungus as a 
white mold that turned dark with age. The figures demonstrate conidia in chains 
and clusters. These characteristics led us to suspect that the case isolate was 
actually <italic>Acrophialophora fusispora</italic>, the features of which we 
have described in a recent report (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The 
report by Arthur et al. indicated that the isolate was sent to University of 
Texas Health Sciences Center (UTHSC) at San Antonio for susceptibility testing. 
Isolates received by UTHSC for susceptibility testing are not routinely 
reexamined to confirm the identification but are maintained in their stock 
collection. This afforded us the opportunity to examine the isolate from this 
case (UTHSC 00-436 &equals; UAMH 10149) and to confirm its identity as 
<italic>A. fusispora.</italic> Although colonies of <italic>A. fusispora</italic>
are often darkly pigmented, isolates vary in pigmentation. The present isolate 
corresponded in features with those described for the isolate from the brain 
tissue of a patient in Saudi Arabia (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Acrophialophora fusispora</italic> is not well known by many 
microbiologists, and its role in mycotic infection is still being evaluated. 
Our review noted another instance of misdetermination of this species in a case 
concerning disseminated infection in a dog. Nonetheless, an isolate that 
deviated so markedly in the characteristics recognized for 
<italic>S. prolificans</italic> should have been subjected to a more careful 
scrutiny by both the authors and reviewers.<?mtl /hellip?></p>

<p>We read with great interest and much chagrin the letters to the editor by 
Drs. Sigler and Sutton and Drs. Guarro and Gene correcting our misidentification 
of <italic>Acrophialophora fusispora</italic> as <italic>Scedosporium 
prolificans</italic> (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The original 
identification was indeed made by an inexperienced technologist, although it 
was confirmed by a more experienced person. However, both were unaware of the 
existence of <italic>A. fusispora</italic>, as were the authors.</p>
<p>In defense of our reviewers, Fig. 2 was added to the manuscript at the 
recommendation of one of the reviewers. We don&apos;t know if the reviewers 
were given the opportunity to examine the added figure prior to publication.</p>
<p>Should we be so fortunate as to grow either organism again, we will not make 
this same mistake. Our error emphasizes the need for technical staff trained in 
mycology to keep up with recent journal publications. We hope others will learn 
from our error.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the literature now contains the first report of 
<italic>A. fusispora</italic> keratouveitis in association with a contact lens 
retained intraocularly over a long term.</p>
