&lt;!-- ============================================================= --&gt;
&lt;!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                  (Beck/DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Minor tweaks before public release. Decision was made not to
     change release number

  8. FRONT MODEL - Added -%front-back.class;, thereby adding
     opitonal &lt;notes&gt; to Front Matter

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)
          
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  7. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A CONTENT MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now.
     Added parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed them 
     from the Element Declarations:
     -  %article-short-model; 
     -  %article-full-model;
     -  %front-model;
     -  %body-model;
     -  %back-model;
      
  6. DOC-BACK-MATTER-ELEMENTS/DOC-BACK-MATTER-MIX 
     a. Reparameterized content for classing reasons. No model change.
     b. Renamed to -%doc-back-matter-mix; 
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Names ending in "-elements" saved for the particular mixes
        that will be added to #PCDATA for a particular element,
     
  5. REMODULARIZATION - Replaced the previous single Publishing
     customization module (journalpubcustomize.ent) with the
     following single-function customization modules:
     - journalpubcustom-modules.ent (declare all the Publishing-
          DTD-specific modules)
     - journalpubcustom-classes.ent (Publishing class over-rides)
     - journalpubcustom-mix.ent (Publishing mix over-rides)
     - journalpubcustom-models.ent (Publishing model over-rides)
     - nlm-citation.ent (just the NLM Citation element, which is
         the only new element created by the Publishing DTD)

  4. NEW VERSION - Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830" 
     on this module and the customization and module-of-modules 
     modules. New customization module for new classing structures.
     Changed fixed DTD version number attribute to "2.0"

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)                                                                

  3. Updated public identifier to "v1.1 20031101"

  2. Changed parameter entity %dtd-version; to reference latest
     version of DTD (version 1.1)

  1. Updated public identifiers for modules.ent and 
     archivecustomize.ent to reflect modules' modification.
     Rationale: To call updated modules.
                                                                   --&gt;

&lt;!--                    DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS                      --&gt;
&lt;!-- ============================================================= --&gt;


&lt;!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange 
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for 
                        publishing, interchange, and repository 
                        DTDs, with the intention that DTDs for 
                        specific purposes, such as this Publishing 
                        DTD, would be developed based on them.
                        
                        This publishing DTD has been optimized for 
                        the creation of new journal articles. This 
                        means that it is far smaller (fewer elements,
                        and fewer choices in many contexts) than was
                        the interchange DTD. Where in the interchange
                        DTD there may have been several ways to 
                        express the same information, only one is 
                        provided for authoring. It was not the 
                        intention to limit the expressive power 
                        licensed by the DTD, but rather to limit the 
                        meaningless choices needed in a full 
                        archiving and interchange DTD that make 
                        conversion from a wide variety of formats as 
                        easy as possible.               
                        
                        This Publishing DTD has been developed from
                        the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite
                        modules, in the approved manner, making 
                        changes to the declarations in those modules 
                        by overriding Parameter Entity defined in
                        the over-rise (customization) modules:   
                           %journalpubcustom-classes.ent;
                           %journalpubcustom-mixes.ent;
                           %journalpubcustom-models.ent;
                        which are all declared in the module:
                           %journalpubcustom-modules.ent;
                        Additional Publishing-DTD-Specific material
                        is defined in the module(s):
                           %nlmcitation.ent;
                        No changes to any of the original Archiving 
                        and Interchange Suite modules are required 
                        in order to use this DTD.                  --&gt;

&lt;!-- ============================================================= --&gt;


&lt;!-- THE MANY ROADS NOT TAKEN
                        In the interest of getting a version of this
                        DTD into production as quickly as practical,
                        several structures and functions that might
                        be appropriately included have been delayed 
                        until a future version of this DTD. Such 
                        components include:
                          - Questions and Answers (These may be 
                              modeled with the current DTDs by using 
                              paragraphs and lists)
                          - Continuing Medical Education material
                             (which frequently contains questions 
                             and answers)
                          - Forms and fill-in-the-blank
                          - Conflict of Interest statements and
                              Financial Disclosure (May be modeled
                              as paragraphs or footnotes)
                          - Electronic and Digital Rights Management
                          - Advertising included in the journal:
                                + Job ads
                                + Classified advertising
                                + Display advertising
                          - Calendars, meeting schedules, and 
                              announcements.  (These can be handled 
                              as ordinary articles or sections within
                              articles)
                          - About the Journal material such as Author
                              Guidelines, Policy and Scope statements,
                              Editorial or advisory boards, detailed
                              indicia, etc.

&lt;!--                    Declares all the external modules that are  
                        part of the modular Journal Archiving and 
                        Interchange DTD Suite library. Thus it does
                        NOT declare itself; the DTD-specific 
                        module-of-modules; or the DTD-specific class,
                        mix, or model over-ride modules. Those are
                        declared in the DTD-specific module of modules.
                           Since this module declares but does not
                        invoke modules, this DTD invokes any modules
                        it uses by referencing the external 
                        Parameter Entities defined in the Module of
                        Modules. To include a set of elements (such 
                        as all the lists or the MathML elements) this 
                        module defines the external Parameter Entity
                        for the module(s) that contains the MathML
                        declarations and the DTD references that 
                        entity.                                    --&gt;

                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).

                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.

                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).

&lt;!--                    Reply, response, or commentary concerning the
                        journal article. In the typical case, the
                        response is included in the same XML package 
                        as the original article, and thus attached 
                        at the end of the article proper.
                        Authoring Note: Frequently a reply or
                        response is an article in its own right, not
                        included as part of the original article.
                        Such an article could use the 
                        &lt;related-article&gt; element in the article 
                        metadata to record the metadata for the 
                        original article.     
                        Conversion Note: This construction can also
                        be used for the pathological case, rarely
                        seen, in which several responses to an 
                        article are lumped together into a single
                        container which is not the original article,
                        merely a collection of responses. In one
                        example we examined, the first two responses
                        were to an original article which was else-
                        where and the third response was a response
                        to the first two responses.                --&gt;

                        What kind of response is this?
                        Note: This does NOT define the kind of
                        article on which the response is commenting,
                        it is metadata for the response itself.

                        being chained together as an introduction,
