         <p class="para">The Article Authoring Document Type Definition (hereafter Authoring DTD) is used to create new journal articles tagged with
            XML elements. The DTD defines the elements (and their attributes) that describe the content of most journal articles, as well
            the content of some non-article journal material, such as editorials and book reviews. The person using this DTD is typically
            one of the article&#8217;s authors or someone (such as a copyeditor) to whom the author has sent the XML files.  The DTD is intended
            for use with XML-aware or text-editing software to guide the writer in choosing tags correctly. This DTD is a simplified version
            of the Journal Publishing (Blue) DTD, which describes the biological and medical journal articles archived in PubMed Central.
         </p>
         <p class="para">This Tag Library provides the documentation for the authoring tag set including examples of element and attribute usage. The
            documentation is divided in to two levels: author documentation and implementor documentation, which is more detailed for
            people who need to modify or maintain the DTD. Author-level reference material includes:
             
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>This brief introduction;</li>
               <li>An explanation of the changes in Version 2.2</li>
               <li>An explanation of how to read and use this Tag Library;</li>
               <li>A top-level introduction to the <a href="n-dd20.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;article&gt;</span></a> tag;
               </li>
               <li>Large reference sections describing all the elements and attributes. (This part of
                   the Tag Library provides individual definitions and tagged examples for most of
                   the elements and attributes used in the DTD.);

               <li>Tree-like hierarchical diagrams that show the structures in the Authoring DTD; and </li>
               <li>A full article sample, which has been tagged as an XML file valid to this DTD.</li>
            </ul> Implementor-level material is also included:
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>A separate reference section describing the Parameter Entities;</li>
               <li>An introduction to the design principles for the whole modular

                   of the DTD (such as naming conventions); and

               <p class="para">This Authoring DTD create(s) a standardized format for new journal articles that can be used by authors to submit publications
                  to journals and to archives such as PubMed Central. The focus on authoring means that this is a smaller, tighter, less inclusive
                  DTD than would have been necessary  to create a journal <em>archiving</em> DTD. Unlike an archiving DTD, which needs to accommodate a wide
                   variety of structures and offers very flexible content models for elements, this DTD is more prescriptive than descriptive
                  and includes many elements whose content must occur in a specified order. This is a DTD optimized for authorship of new journal
                  articles, where regularization and control of content is important, and where it is useful rather than harmful to have only
                  one way to tag a structure.
               </p>
               <p class="para">Since no assumptions can be made concerning the processing software and editorial situation that will receive an article authored
                  in this DTD, tagging that forces specific formatting has been avoided. There is no way for an author to number his/her lists
                  explicitly, for example, or to manually number the cited references, since many journals have their own citation policies.
                  Numbers for the cited references must be generated by software to match editorial policy. For proofing purposes the stlyesheets
                  that may be used to produce PDF from these tagged articles number the references as counting numbers and the stylesheets that
                  produce HTML for proofing display the identifier of the <a href="n-kku0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;ref&gt;</span></a> as the number.

               <ul class="bullist">
                  <li><em>Articles</em>. This is not a DTD for complete journals. The Authoring DTD models journal articles, where such an article is defined as
                     the typical research article found in an STM journal. By design, the definition of an article is broad enough to include other
                     article-like material found in journals, for example, editorials, short new pieces, obituaries, meeting reports, and book
                     or product reviews. 
                  </li>
                  <li><em>Header and Body</em>. This DTD describes both the metadata for a journal article and the content of the article. Both are required to make a complete
                     article.
                  </li>
                  <li><em>Multidisciplinary</em>.  Although designed for biomedical journals, this DTD should be sufficiently general to describe not only STM journals but
                     technical journals in any field.
                  </li>

               <p class="para">The Authoring DTD has been written as a set of &#8220;modules&#8221; that make use of the modules of the Archiving and Interchange DTD
                  Suite. Each module is a separate physical file, no module
                   is an entire DTD by itself, and modules can be combined into a number of
                   different DTDs. The module files are primarily intended for ease of constructing new DTDs and ease of maintenance.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The major disadvantage of a modular system is the longer learning
                   curve, since it may not be immediately obvious <em>where</em>
                   within the system to find a particular element or attribute cluster. To help
                   with this, the description of each element in the Element Section of this
                   documentation names the module in which that element is defined.

               <p class="para">Because access for a wide range of output devices, as well as for
                         the visually impaired, is becoming more and more important in the STM journal
                         community, the modules in the Archiving and Interchange Suite were designed to follow, as much as
                         possible, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/"><span class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                               2.0</span></a> working draft.  This DTD is based on the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite, which used the August 2002 specification, which
                  was the latest accessibility specification
                         available when the Suite was initially constructed. This Specification specifies
                         accessibility guidelines on many levels from design through application. The
                         guidelines which pertain to the modeling of materials were followed to at least
                         Level-2 compliance. For example, a <a href="n-n780.html"><span class="elementname">Long Description</span></a>
                         <a href="n-n780.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;long-desc&gt;</span></a> element was defined as part of many
                         other elements, such as <a href="n-tv50.html"><span class="elementname">Figure</span></a> <a href="n-tv50.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;fig&gt;</span></a>, so it can be added not only to all figures and other graphical objects, but to any section of the text (for example, to
                  a <a href="n-8uc0.html"><span class="elementname">Boxed Text</span></a> <a href="n-8uc0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;boxed-text&gt;</span></a>) to provide an accessible description of the object. The <a href="n-qst0.html"><span class="attrtag">xml:lang</span></a> attribute was added to all
                         section-level elements and many paragraph-level elements to permit explicit
                         indication of the language of the content, as required by these guidelines. The <a href="n-m320.html"><span class="elementname">Abbreviation or Acronym</span></a> <a href="n-m320.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;abbrev&gt;</span></a> element (also to be used for acronyms) was added to meet Checkpoint 4.3.
