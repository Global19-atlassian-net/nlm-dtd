RNA mutants that cause unusually long telomeres with deregulated structure led

binding to the entire telomere are irrelevant to the process of meiosis.
Moreover, we demonstrate that extreme difference in telomere size between two
homologous chromosomes is compatible with the normal function of telomeres
during meiosis. In contrast, the structure of the most terminal telomeric
repeats is critical for normal meiosis. Our results demonstrate that telomeres
play a critical role during meiotic division and that their terminal cap

sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are special
DNA&#x2013;protein structures at the natural ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes
that cap and protect chromosome ends from fusions, recombination, and
degradation. Telomeres are synthesized by the specialized enzyme telomerase,
which adds new telomeric repeats by copying a short template sequence within its
own RNA moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Greider and Blackburn,
1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Shippen-Lentz and Blackburn,
1990</xref>). Mutations in the telomerase RNA template residues are incorporated
into telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn, 1995</xref>). Some
mutations in the telomeric sequence cause drastic changes in telomere length and
structure associated with many cellular phenotypes and in some cases with cell
death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn, 1995</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kirk <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). These changes were
suggested to be caused by loss of binding of specialized proteins to telomeric
DNA length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn,
1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Krauskopf and Blackburn,
1996</xref>).</p><p>Telomeres were shown to be involved in various cellular
processes. Among these are chromosome maintenance, silencing of gene expression,
signaling cellular senescence, and meiosis</p><p>Meiosis is a cell division
process common to almost all eukaryotes. Meiosis initiates with DNA synthesis
followed by prophase I, during which homologous chromosomes align side by side
(homolog pairing) and then form a structure termed the synaptonemal complex
(reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Roeder, 1997</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In recent
years, evidence has accumulated suggesting the involvement of telomeres in
homolog pairing during meiosis. A distinguishing feature of meiotic telomere
behavior of many organisms has been a configuration termed the bouquet
arrangement in which the ends of most chromosomes are attached to a small region
of the nuclear envelope during early prophase (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B9">Dernberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Recently, the bouquet
arrangement has also been observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B31">Trelles-Sticken <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), suggesting that it is a
highly conserved meiotic feature. Light microscopic and fluorescence in situ
hybridization studies have established that the bouquet arrangement and telomere
clustering overlap temporally with zygotene, the stage of prophase in which
homolog pairing is first detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dernberg
<italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Scherthan <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Trelles-Sticken <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bass <italic>et al.</italic>,
1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2000</xref>). These studies, as well
as studies in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B4">Chikashige <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), have also shown that
telomeres cluster de novo during meiotic prophase and have ruled out the
possibility of premeiotic clustering.</p><p>Studies of the striking
telomere-mediated chromosome movement during the early meiotic prophase in
<italic>S. pombe</italic> revealed the importance of telomere clustering for proper
meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Chikashige <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Scherthan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chikashige <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In the
past few years, the body of cytological evidence suggesting a role for telomeres
in meiosis has been supported by several genetic studies. These studies,
conducted in budding and fission yeast and in mice, examined the meiotic
phenotypes caused by mutations in telomere-associated proteins and of cells
harboring circular chromosomes. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a role for
the Tam1p/Ndj1p-telomere&#x2013;associated protein in homolog pairing and the
stabilization of homology-dependent interactions was suggested (<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Chua and Roeder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B7">Conrad <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>S. pombe</italic>
telomere binding protein Taz1p was also shown to be essential for spore
viability and the characteristic telomere clustering at the spindle pole body
(SPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cooper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nimmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Proper telomere
clustering thus appears to be required to facilitate pairing and
recombination.</p><p>A study of meiotic kinetics in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has
revealed that in the absence of telomeres, the characteristic delay in meiotic
prophase I indicative of pairing is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B21">Rockmill and Roeder, 1998</xref>). Therefore, it was concluded that
without telomeres, there was little or none homolog pairing.</p><p><italic>S.
pombe</italic> cells in which all three chromosomes were circular exhibited severe
defects in meiosis, as evident from their greatly reduced spore viability (<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Naito <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This again
indicated a crucial role for telomeres in meiosis.</p><p>To directly study the
effect of telomere structure on meiosis, we have studied the meiotic phenotypes
of telomeric mutants of the budding yeast, <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>, in
which the structure of telomeres themselves is altered. In contrast to its
relative budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B20">Prescott and Blackburn 1997</xref>), mutations in the template region
of the RNA subunit of telomerase of <italic>K. lactis</italic> are precisely
incorporated into new telomeric repeats and result in predictable and
homogeneous repeats. Depending on the mutation, this results in alterations in
telomere length and in the structure of the telomeric complex (<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn, 1995</xref>). Therefore, any
effect on meiosis can be attributed to defined changes in the telomeric
structure and/or function, and direct evidence for the role of telomeres in
meiosis can be obtained. Here we have used telomeric RNA (<italic>TER1</italic>)
template mutations to study the role of telomeres in meiosis. Our findings
demonstrate that <italic>ter1</italic> mutants with long and deregulated telomeres are
severely defective in meiosis. By comparing the meiotic phenotypes of two
<italic>ter1</italic> mutants, we show that general telomere size and the binding
potential for Rap1p throughout the entire length of the telomere are
insignificant for the process of meiosis. We also show that extreme
heterogeneity in telomere size of homologous chromosomes has no effect on the
normal function of telomeres during meiosis. In contrast, we demonstrate that
the structure of the most terminal telomeric repeats is critical for normal
meiosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials/methods"><title>MATERIALS AND

Acc/Acc Mutants Leads to Severe Defects in Meiosis</title><p>We reasoned that if
a role for telomeres in meiosis existed, mutants whose telomeres are severely
abnormal in length and/or structure would fail to undergo normal meiosis. We
chose to study a <italic>K. lactis</italic> strain harboring a telomerase RNA template
mutation termed <italic>ter1-Acc</italic>. This mutation consists of a G to A
substitution in the template sequence of <italic>TER1,</italic> the gene coding for the
RNA moiety of telomerase. This substitution is incorporated faithfully into all
newly synthesized telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">McEachern
and Blackburn, 1995</xref>). The abnormal repeats contain an altered binding
site for the protein Rap1p, reducing the in vitro binding affinity for Rap1p by
300-fold relative to the wild-type site (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B14">Krauskopf and Blackburn, 1996</xref>). Because Rap1p is essential for
telomere length regulation, the <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> mutation leads to immediate
deregulation of telomere length and increased mean telomere length in vivo
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn, 1995</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Krauskopf and Blackburn, 1996</xref>). Three diploid
strains were created: <italic>TER1/TER1</italic>, <italic>TER1/ter1-Acc</italic>
(<italic>TER1/Acc</italic>), and <italic>ter1-Acc/ter1-Acc</italic> (<italic>Acc/Acc</italic>). First,
their telomeric phenotypes were confirmed. Total genomic DNA digested with
<italic>Eco</italic>RI was analyzed by a Southern blotting with the use of a probe
specific for wild-type telomeric repeats (which exist in the internal part of
the telomere in <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn, 1995</xref>). In the <italic>TER1/TER1</italic>
strain, a typical telomeric pattern was obtained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig"
rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). The pattern of bands is due to the different
locations of the <italic>Eco</italic>RI recognition sites in the 12 subtelomeric regions
of the six <italic>K. lactis</italic> chromosomes. In contrast, and as previously seen
in <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> haploid strains, mean telomere size was greatly elevated in
the diploid <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains compared with the characteristic wild-type
telomere length. Moreover, as previously seen in <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> haploid
strains, the telomeric signal appeared as a smear. This loss of the
characteristic pattern of bands is indicative of telomere length deregulation
because the cell population now harbors a variety of telomere sizes (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). In the heterozygote
<italic>TER1</italic>/<italic>Acc</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes
3&#x2013;6), where both <italic>TER1</italic> and <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> were present in a
single cell, distinct bands appeared in addition to a faint smear. This
suggests, that once a wild-type repeat is added onto a telomere end by TER1,
this telomere's chances to remain regulated are very high because it becomes
inaccessible to telomerase. Residual smearing observed in the telomeric pattern
of these strains may reflect occasional addition of telomeric repeats by
<italic>ter1-Acc</italic> in individual cells, followed by incorporation of a wild-type
repeat(s) by TER1.</p><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Telomere

defects in meiosis result in the production of mature tetrads whose spores are
genetically aberrant (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Kupiec <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Naito <italic>et al.</italic>,
1998</xref>). To test for the presence of such aberrations, spore viability was
assessed. To measure spore viability, we counted the number of spores that
germinated and produced colonies upon tetrad dissection. Nonviability of spores
was defined as the inability to form visible colonies. As seen in Table <xref
ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, spores originating from the <italic>Acc/Acc</italic>
diploid were more than fourfold (22&#x0025;) less viable than spores from the
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic> or <italic>TER1/Acc</italic> diploids (95 and 98&#x0025;,
respectively). This failure to produce viable products indicates that even in
the rare event of full tetrad formation (3&#x0025;), the meiotic process in
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> diploids is fundamentally defective. Spore nonviability could
result from a physiological defect leading to inability to germinate.
Alternatively, it could result from a genetic defect in the spore products
themselves. In this case, spores would germinate but not be able to form
full-grown colonies. We observed that nearly all the spores scored as nonviable
actually germinated and divided to produce microcolonies of &#x003C;10 cells
(our unpublished results). This observation confirmed that the inviability of
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> spore products was due to a genetic defect rather than to a
physiological defect in germination.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of Meiosis in
Acc/Acc Mutants</title><p>Our observations on the effects of the long and
heterogeneous telomeres in the <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strain on sporulation rate and
spore viability confirmed that telomeres have an important role in meiosis. To
identify the stage of meiosis, in which <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> are defective<italic>,</italic>
we followed the meiotic process through its different stages in
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic> and <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains. We first tested whether the
mutant was able to enter meiosis and duplicate its DNA. Cultures were grown to
saturation in rich medium and transferred to liquid sporulation medium to induce
sporulation. Samples were taken from both cultures at consecutive time points,
and DNA content was analyzed by FACS. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig"
rid="F2">2</xref>A, in both strains approximately two-thirds of the cells had
gone through a cycle of DNA replication by 27 h after transfer to sporulation
medium. Thus, the early meiotic event of DNA synthesis was not impaired in the
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strain. To test at which stage of meiosis <italic>Acc/Acc</italic>
cells were arrested, we compared the timing of appearance and the fractions of
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic> and <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells with one, two, and four nuclei,
corresponding, respectively, to cells before the first meiotic division, cells
that were past the first but not the second division, and cells that completed
both divisions. Samples were drawn at different time points after transfer to
sporulation medium and were fixed and stained with DAPI to enable visualization
of nuclei. The results of this experiment are presented graphically in Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B. Two-nuclear cells were most abundant
between 15 and 30 h after transfer to sporulation medium. During this time they
averaged 7&#x0025; in <italic>TER1/TER1</italic> and 3.5&#x0025; in <italic>Acc/Acc</italic>.
These values are probably an underestimate, because the three-dimensional
orientation of two nuclei in a cell can cause their fluorescence signals to
merge, and the two are then counted as one. Four-nuclear cells started to appear
&#x223C;17 h after transfer to sporulation medium, and reached their maximal
concentration &#x223C;30 h after transfer to sporulation medium. In the
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic> strain they reached 60&#x0025; of total cells, whereas in
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> this value was reduced to 5&#x0025;. From these results we
conclude that the majority of <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells duplicate their DNA as do
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic> cells. However, in contrast to the latter, most of the mutant
cells do not proceed to divide and arrest before MI. The minority of cells that
do manage to continue beyond DNA synthesis are not delayed in timing of meiosis.

Telomeric Mutation ter1-Bsi</title><p>The meiotic phenotypes of the
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strain clearly showed that long and deregulated telomeres,
associated with reduced Rap1p binding affinity, were inhibitory to the meiotic
process. This effect could be attributed to their increased size, the
heterogeneity of telomere length within each cell, or the lack of Rap1p binding.
To distinguish between these possibilities and further study the relation
between telomere structure and meiosis, we next examined the meiotic phenotype
of a milder telomere mutant. The <italic>ter1-Bsi</italic> mutation consists of a single
template base substitution adjacent to the <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> substitution. Like
the latter, the <italic>Bsi</italic> substitution falls within the Rap1p binding site,
and in vitro, binding affinity of Rap1p to the mutated site is reduced 100-fold
relative to the wild-type site and is three times higher than its affinity to
<italic>Acc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Krauskopf and Blackburn,
1996</xref>). The characteristic phenotype of long and deregulated telomeres is
observed in <italic>ter1-Bsi</italic> cells but is less immediate than in
<italic>ter1-Acc</italic>, with telomeres reaching their maximal length and
heterogeneity after 50&#x2013;100 cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B17">McEachern and Blackburn, 1995</xref>). To test the effect of the
<italic>ter1-Bsi</italic> mutation on meiosis, the diploid strains
<italic>ter1-Bsi/ter1-Bsi</italic> (<italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic>) and <italic>TER1/ter1-Bsi</italic>
(<italic>TER1/Bsi</italic>) were created and their telomere phenotypes were confirmed,
as described above for the <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains. As can be seen in Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane 3, telomeres of the homozygote
strain <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> were deregulated, as expected. As was the case with the
<italic>TER1/Acc</italic> strain, the telomeres of the heterozygote <italic>TER1/Bsi</italic>
(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane 2) were semiregulated,
because distinct bands were visible, in addition to a smear. The mitotic
phenotypes of the three strains were assessed by a plating efficiency assay. The
efficiency of the <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> strain was 80&#x0025; compared with that of
the <italic>TER1/TER1</italic> strain, whereas the plating efficiency of the
heterozygote strain, <italic>TER1/Bsi</italic> was similar to that of the
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic> strain (our unpublished results).</p><fig

strain (10&#x0025;) was significantly lower than for <italic>TER1/TER1</italic> cells
(43&#x0025;). Thus, <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> cells, like <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells, are
clearly impaired in their ability to complete some stage(s) of meiosis. The
heterozygote <italic>TER1/Bsi</italic> had the same sporulation rate as
<italic>TER1/TER1</italic>. Therefore, we concluded that it was able to successfully
complete all crucial stages of meiosis. Although the sporulation rate of the
<italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> strain was substantially reduced compared with wild type, spore
viability was less affected and reached 70&#x0025; (Table <xref ref-type="table"

that in the 10&#x0025; of <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> cells that succeeded to complete
meiosis, in most cases, the meiotic mechanism itself was sufficiently intact to
produce viable meiotic products. This contrasts with the situation in

of Telomere Sizes Reveals Similarity in Telomere Sizes of Acc/Acc and
Bsi/Bsi</title><p>Having seen that the meiotic phenotypes of <italic>ter1</italic>
mutant strains correlated with the severity of their telomere phenotypes, we
wanted to examine how this difference correlated with differences in several
characteristics of telomeres in the two strains. We hypothesized that such a
correlation would be indicative of the role of telomeres in meiosis.</p><p>The
telomeric patterns of <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> and <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> strains showed that
in both strains telomere length is deregulated, and mean length is greatly
increased compared with wild type (Figures <xref ref-type="fig"
rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). One possible
explanation for the difference between the severity of meiotic defects in
<italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> relative to <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains would be that the
telomeres of the latter strain are in fact longer but that this difference was
not apparent due to the limitations of resolution of the gel system used. The
limit mobility of DNA in standard electrophoresis is only 15&#x2013;20 kb. To
better resolve long telomeric DNA fragments, we used pulse-field electrophoresis
of <italic>Eco</italic>RI-digested genomic DNA in a CHEF apparatus to separate
high-molecular weight fragments. Blotting and hybridization were performed as
described for conventional telomere blots. As seen in Figure <xref
ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, in the diploid mutant strains <italic>Acc/Acc</italic>
and <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> the mean telomere lengths were very similar to each other
in the high range: the bulk of telomeric hybridizing fragments being on
&#x223C;20- to &#x223C;50-kb fragments. The faint smear seen above 50 kb in the
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strain may indicate that a very small fraction of telomeres in
this strain was &#x003E;50 kb in length. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that
differences in telomere lengths per se accounted for the differences observed in
the meiotic phenotypes of <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> and <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> strains.

Defects in ter1 Mutants</title><p>As mentioned above, the in vitro binding
affinity of Rap1p to Bsi telomeric repeats was 3 times higher than to Acc
repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Krauskopf and Blackburn, 1996</xref>).
Because telomere length was indistinguishable between diploid <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic>
and <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains, the observed differences in the severity of
meiotic phenotypes between the two mutants might be accounted for by the
difference in the number of Rap1p molecules associated with the entire telomere
or with its most distal end. It is possible that Rap1p molecules bound
throughout the entire telomere are important for a putative telomere meiotic
function. Alternatively, it is conceivable that only the Rap1p bound to the most
distal end of the telomere is important for such meiotic function. To
distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the meiotic phenotypes of
<italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> or <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains whose mutant telomeres were capped
by incorporation of a very few telomeric repeats capable of binding Rap1p onto
the termini of their telomeres. We reasoned that if the number of Rap1p
molecules bound throughout the telomere was important for meiosis then capping
would not suppress the meiotic defects in either mutant strain. In addition, the
mutant strains would still exhibit differences in the severity of their meiotic
phenotypes compared with each other. In contrast, if normal binding of Rap1p to
the most distal repeats of the telomere is both necessary and sufficient for
meiosis and uncapping of the telomeric termini of <italic>ter1</italic> telomeres was
the sole reason for the meiotic defects exhibited by <italic>ter1</italic> strains then
recapping with normal repeats would suffice to override these meiotic defects.
Moreover, in this case we would expect that meiosis would be rescued to a
similar extent in both strains. We have previously reported that such capping of
long and deregulated telomeres was sufficient to restore telomere length
control. In these cases, telomere length, although regulated, became set at new
sizes, often much longer than the normal length (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B15">Krauskopf and Blackburn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B29">Smith and Blackburn, 1999</xref>). Therefore, we compared the ability
of strains with long telomeres, capped or uncapped, to undergo meiosis. The
<italic>ter1-Bcl</italic> mutation, which introduces a <italic>Bcl1</italic> restriction site
into the newly incorporated telomeric repeats, is located outside the Rap1p
binding site and was previously shown to have no effect on telomere length or
cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Krauskopf and Blackburn,
1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Roy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).
Therefore, it can be used to cap telomeres with marked but phenotypically silent
telomeric repeats. <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> and <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> cells were transformed
with an integrative copy of <italic>ter1-Bcl</italic>. Telomeric patterns were compared
among the original <italic>ter1</italic> strains and those capped by <italic>ter1-Bcl</italic>.
As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lanes 3&#x2013;6,
upon introduction of the <italic>ter1-Bcl</italic> gene (Acc capped lanes), the
telomeric patterns of four independent clones immediately exhibited discrete
bands indicative of capping. This indicates that upon capping, the size of all
telomeres of all cells emanating from the original &#x201C;capped&#x201D; cell
are stably kept throughout hundreds of cell divisions. As previously seen, the
newly capped telomeres were kept at sizes significantly longer than the
wild-type telomeres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lane 1)
with mean length similar to that of the original <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> (Figure <xref
ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lane 2). This result showed that upon capping
of deregulated telomeres in <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strains by <italic>Bcl</italic> repeats,
telomere length control was resumed, as expected. In contrast, the original
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> strain or a strain that lost the <italic>ter1 Bcl</italic> gene after
5-FOA (Acc ex-capped), exhibited a smear characteristic of deregulated telomeres
(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lane 2 and lanes 7 and 8,
respectively). To verify that capping required the addition of only a few Bcl
repeats, the same genomic DNA samples were double digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI
and <italic>Bcl1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, lanes
9&#x2013;16). <italic>Eco</italic>RI cuts in subtelomeric locations internal to the
telomeric repeats (unique to each telomere), whereas <italic>Bcl1</italic> specifically
cleaves off the marked Bcl telomeric repeats added onto the preexisting repeats
of the telomeres. Therefore, the resulting telomeric fragment pattern reflects
the lengths of the remaining repeat tracts located internally to the newly
incorporated Bcl repeats. Comparing the telomeric pattern of the double-digested
DNA with that resulting from restriction digest with <italic>Eco</italic>RI alone
reflects the extent of incorporation of <italic>Bcl1</italic> repeats onto the ends of
the telomeres. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A,
lanes 11&#x2013;14, upon double digestion with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bcl1</italic>,
most of the telomeric bands were only slightly shorter than those bands seen
after digestion with <italic>Eco</italic>RI alone (lanes 3&#x2013;6). Some shorter
fragments are also generated by cutting at <italic>Bcl1</italic> sites in certain
subtelomeric locations. Hence, in most telomeres, only a very few <italic>Bcl</italic>
repeats had been incorporated onto the chromosomal termini. To confirm that all
<italic>Bcl</italic> repeats were indeed cleaved by <italic>Bcl1</italic>, the same blot was
stripped and reprobed with a Bcl-specific probe under stringent conditions
(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). As seen in Figure <xref
ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, lanes 11&#x2013;14, after cleavage with
<italic>Bcl1</italic> the telomeric fragments no longer hybridized with the Bcl-specific
probe, whereas the telomeric fragments, which resulted from digestion with
<italic>Eco</italic>RI alone (lanes 3&#x2013;6), still hybridized. This confirmed that
cleavage with <italic>Bcl1</italic> was complete. Capping was confirmed by the same
manner for the capped <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> strains (our unpublished results).

Chromosomes Is Compatible with Normal Meiosis</title><p>Incorporation of Bcl
repeats competent to bind Rap1p onto the most distal portion of the telomere
caused the disappearance of the heterogeneity in telomere length characteristic
of uncapped telomeres. This Bcl capping was thus evidenced by the substantial
narrowing of telomere size range and disappearance of the smear observed in the
original uncapped strains. This resulting pattern of discrete bands indicates
that upon capping, the telomeres of a given cell are &#x201C;captured&#x201D; at
the sizes they had at the moment of capping and that this structure is
subsequently passed on to its progeny. This results in a uniform clonal cell
population with respect to telomere sizes. In contrast, before capping, telomere
length heterogeneity reflects a situation in which the telomeres within a cell
can vary greatly in size, including telomeres of homologous chromosomes.
Therefore, we tested two possibilities that could explain how capping rescues
meiosis in <italic>ter1</italic>-capped strains. The first was that it is the binding of
Rap1p to the most distal repeat(s) alone that is crucial for meiosis. The second
was that it is the narrowing of telomere size range within the same cell,
specifically that of homologous chromosomes, that is crucial for meiosis. To
distinguish between these two possibilities, we directly tested the effect of
telomere length heterogeneity on meiosis. We created diploid strains that were
genotypically wild type but contained two distinct sets of chromosomes: one with
long telomeres (capped and therefore regulated) and the other with
wild-type&#x2013;sized telomeres. These strains were created by sporulating the
capped diploid strains, either <italic>Acc/Bcl</italic>-capped or
<italic>Bsi/Bcl</italic>-capped. Spore clones that retained the ter1-Bcl allele had long
but regulated telomeres (capped) and were genotypically wild type because the
<italic>Bcl</italic> mutation is silent. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A
shows representative telomeric patterns of spore clones of capped Acc strains
(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, lanes 3&#x2013;5, TER ex-Acc)
and capped Bsi strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B, lanes 3
and 4). These strains were mated with a &#x201C;na&#x00EF;ve&#x201D;
<italic>TER1</italic> strain with normal-sized telomeres. As can be seen in Figure <xref
ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, lanes 6&#x2013;11(TER ex-Acc &#x00D7; TER),
and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B, lanes 5&#x2013;8 (TER ex-Bsi
&#x00D7; TER), in the resulting diploids, all the &#x201C;input&#x201D;
telomeres remained unchanged in size or structure. This resulted in two sets of
chromosomes in the same cell: one with short telomeric restriction fragments
ranging from 1 to 5 kb (contributed by the <italic>TER1</italic> parent) and one with
long telomeric restriction fragments ranging from 5 to &#x003E;20 kb (apparently
contributed by the capped <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> or <italic>ter1-Bsi</italic> parent,
respectively). This contrasts with the situation in the corresponding
heterozygous <italic>TER1/ter1-Acc</italic> or <italic>TER1/Bsi</italic> strains, which have
intermediate telomere sizes and structure, as seen in Figures <xref

sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Many aspects of telomere function and
metabolism are still largely unknown. The rapid advances in telomere research
during recent years have repeatedly demonstrated that telomeres perform complex,
and sometimes unexpected, cellular functions. One of these functions may be
their involvement in the meiotic process. The bouquet structure conserved among
many organisms has led researchers to hypothesize that the ends of homologous
chromosomes have an active role in spatially facilitating their pairing. More
recently, this hypothesis was strengthened by genetic studies performed in
mutants of telomere-associated proteins.</p><p>We set out to address the
question of the role of telomeres in meiosis by investigating the meiotic
behavior of telomeres with defined alterations in telomere size and structure.
The experimental system used, the budding yeast, <italic>K. lactis</italic>, a close
relative of the widely studied <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, combines the advantages
of yeast as a well-characterized genetic system for the study of meiosis with
considerable specific advantages for telomere study and
manipulation.</p><sec><title>Timing of Telomeric Involvement in
Meiosis</title><p>The two <italic>ter1</italic> mutations we analyzed unambiguously
caused a defective meiotic phenotype, thus providing direct evidence for a
meiotic role for telomeres. First, the kinetics of progress of <italic>Acc/Acc</italic>
cells through the meiotic process showed that <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells when
induced to sporulate, like wild-type cells, initiate meiosis by going through
one round of DNA replication. However, most <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells fail to
proceed further to complete meiotic division I as indicated by the fact that
they remain with one nucleus. The minority of cells that do proceed beyond this
stage continue through the two divisions to the completion of meiosis II with
the same kinetics as wild-type cells. However, only 22&#x0025; of their progeny
are viable.</p><p>Telomeres may play an active role in meiosis such as ensuring
proper segregation of chromosomes. In this case, it is possible that
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells that proceed beyond DNA synthesis encounter a catastrophe
due to their inability to carry out this role properly. According to this
&#x201C;active&#x201D; model, escapers, which somehow manage to proceed beyond
meiosis I, are expected to give rise to aberrant products. Alternatively,
telomeres might be envisioned to play a passive role in meiosis, such as being
monitored by a meiotic checkpoint apparatus. In this case, after DNA
replication, telomeres with Acc repeats may be perceived as abnormal and elicit
a checkpoint signal to arrest progression beyond this stage. According to this
&#x201C;passive&#x201D; model, escapers, which somehow evade the checkpoint
surveillance system, are expected to give rise to normally viable products.
Therefore, the fact that the few <italic>Acc/Acc</italic> cells that did manage to
complete meiosis and produce tetrads gave rise to inviable spores, supports the
active model. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that telomeres play a
dual role, that of being monitored by a checkpoint apparatus and later on a more
active role.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomeric Element Essential to
Meiosis</title><p>What properties of <italic>ter1</italic> telomeres can make them
incapable of fulfilling their normal meiotic role, according to a model of
active involvement? Telomeres of <italic>ter1</italic> cells are abnormal in at least
three respects: mean length, size uniformity, and Rap1p binding
potential.</p><sec><title>Excessive Telomere Length.</title><p>Conceivably,
excessive telomere length could mechanically hinder a function such as physical
facilitation of homologous chromosome alignment. For example, a cluster of
abnormally long telomeres may not be able to support chromosomal movements
properly. This model is not supported by our results: <italic>ter1-Bsi</italic>
telomeres are as long as <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> telomeres, yet the meiotic phenotype
of <italic>ter1-Bsi</italic> is much less severe. Moreover, upon capping of
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> or <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic>, telomeres remain very long, whereas their
meiotic defect is completely suppressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Heterogeneity of
Telomere Lengths.</title><p>Wild-type <italic>K. lactis</italic> telomeres, as is the
case in most organisms, are more or less uniform in length in a single cell.
Theoretically, this uniformity may be necessary to carry out an active role in
meiosis. For example, telomere-mediated chromosome alignment could be impaired
if telomeres of homologous chromosomes were not the same length. To assess the
effect of heterogeneity between two individual telomeres of homologs in the same
cell, we constructed diploid strains containing one haploid set of chromosomes
with normal-sized telomeres, and the other haploid set with very long telomeres.
The fact that sporulation efficiency and spore viability were completely normal
in these strains excludes the possibility that telomere size heterogeneity
between clonal homologs per se impairs the meiotic function of
telomeres.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased Rap1p Binding Potential of the Entire
Telomere.</title><p>Rap1p itself may be the active mediator of telomeric
involvement in meiosis. For example, it may interact with other proteins to
initiate and maintain the bouquet formation. Taz1p and the recently reported
<italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of Rap1p are both required for proper meiosis and
specifically for the bouquet-reminiscent &#x201C;horsetail&#x201D; movement
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cooper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hiraoka, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B19">Nimmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). It was not shown, however,
whether the factor directly active in <italic>S. pombe</italic> meiosis was the protein
itself, or the telomeric structure that depends upon its regulatory
activity.</p><p>Relatively very few Rap1p molecules are expected to be bound to
the telomeric repeats in <italic>ter1</italic> strains. Therefore, it was conceivable
that their number may be too small to fulfill a putative active role in meiosis.
To test this model, we capped <italic>ter1-Bsi</italic> and <italic>ter1-Acc</italic> telomeres
with a few Rap1p binding repeats. On capping, both meiotic parameters,
sporulation efficiency and spore viability, were completely rescued. As shown by
specific restriction digestion, the entire length of the telomeres contained
mostly <italic>Bsi</italic> or <italic>Acc</italic> repeats in the respective strains.
Therefore, in the capped strains, meiosis was normal despite the fact that most
of the telomeric repeats within a given telomere had decreased Rap1p binding
capability. Moreover, upon capping, no differences could be detected between
<italic>Acc/Acc</italic> and <italic>Bsi/Bsi</italic> despite the fact that <italic>Bsi</italic>
telomeric repeats are able to bind Rap1p 3 times better than <italic>Acc</italic>
repeats. This further supports the conclusion that differences in Rap1p binding
throughout the entire telomeric length are insignificant for the meiotic
process.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of Capping at Telomeres.</title><p>A putative
active role of telomeres may require their &#x201C;cap&#x201D; structure to be
intact. Here we refer to capping in its most general form: a functional
structure at the very end of the telomere. We have previously shown that
telomere length regulation is particularly dependent on the most distal
double-stranded repeats of the telomere. In view of their special importance for
telomere functions in mitotic cells, the most distal telomeric repeats may also
be important for carrying out a putative meiotic role. In <italic>ter1</italic> mutants
the distal repeats are altered and the degree of the loss of Rap1p binding to
the mutated repeats correlated with the severity of the meiotic phenotype of
these mutants. Therefore, we speculated that this might underlie their meiotic
phenotypes. The capping experiments referred to above show unambiguously that it
is the impairment of this terminal cap structure that is responsible for the
severe meiotic defects exhibited by <italic>ter1</italic> mutants. The fact that meiosis
was not impaired in the heterozygote strains whose telomeres were capped further
stresses the importance of the terminal cap for meiosis.</p><p>Although the
mutations tested were single base substitutions within the Rap1p binding domain,
the possibility that it is the impairment in binding of a telomere binding
factor other than Rap1p that accounted for the observed meiotic defects in ter1
mutants, cannot be ruled out.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Role of Telomeric Cap
Structure in Meiosis</title><p>What is the role of the cap structure in meiosis?
As mentioned above, normal telomeres are required for passage through the first
meiotic division and for viable spore production. Because capping of mutant
telomeres suppresses both phenotypes, we conclude that it is the very distal
repeats that carry out those two putative functions, although not necessarily
through the same mechanism.</p><p>Recently, it was shown that in the absence of
the telomeric-associated meiosis-specific protein Ndj1p, telomeres are scattered
throughout the nucleus and fail to form the perinuclear meiosis-specific
distribution pattern characteristic of this stage. Because Rap1p and Ndj1p show
extensive colocalization in pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B5">Chua and Roeder 1997</xref>.), it is possible that Ndj1p may function
together with Rap1p to tether meiotic telomeres to the nuclear periphery (<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Trelles-Sticken <italic>et al.</italic>,
2000</xref>).</p><p>Evidence from <italic>S. pombe</italic> showed that the pairing of
homologous chromosomes is impaired in several mutants that are defective in
telomere clustering at the SPB. A mutant defective in kms1, a component of the
SPB that functions specifically in meiosis, failed to form a telomere cluster
due to the disintegration of the SPB structure, and exhibited a reduced rate of
meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Shimanuki <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). As mentioned above, in mutants of the telomere binding
protein taz1, telomeres fail to cluster at the SPB during meiotic prophase,
causing severe meiotic phenotype. Recently, it has been shown that telomeres of
rodent spermatocytes are associated with the same telomere binding proteins that
are associated with them in somatic cells (mouse Trf1, rat TRF2, and Rap1 at
meiotic telomeres of both rodents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Scherthan
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>)</p><p>Taken together, it is possible that in
yeast, a telomere binding protein, most likely Rap1p, which is bound to the very
end of the telomere, is able to anchor chromosomes by interacting with a
meiosis-specific telomere binding protein(s), perhaps Ndj1p or other associated
proteins. This anchorage may be essential to facilitate telomere localization
and the unique chromosomal movements observed during
meiosis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank
