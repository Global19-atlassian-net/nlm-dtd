<body><?mtl hellip?><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Geriatric day
hospitals developed rapidly in the United Kingdom in the 1960s as an important
component of care provision. The model has since been widely applied in several
Western countries. Day hospitals provide multidisciplinary assessment and
rehabilitation in an outpatient setting and have a pivotal position between
hospital and home based services. Although there is considerable descriptive
literature on day hospital care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> concern
has been expressed that evidence for effectiveness is equivocal and that day
hospital care is expensive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> We therefore
undertook a systematic review of the randomised trials of day hospital
care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The primary question
addressed was whether older patients attending a day hospital would experience
better outcomes than those receiving alternative forms of care. We anticipated
considerable heterogeneity in both the intervention and control services and so
specified key subgroup comparisons before reviewing the
trials.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>We set out to identify all
relevant controlled clinical trials of geriatric day hospital care. A day
hospital was defined as an outpatient facility where older patients attend for a
full or near full day and receive multidisciplinary rehabilitation in a health
care setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> Trials evaluating social
day centres, other types of day hospitals such as those for patients with
dementia or psychiatric conditions, and single condition day hospitals were
excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Search strategy</title><p>We searched for
relevant published and unpublished papers up to January 1997. Our search
strategy included Medline, SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in
Europe), BIDS (Bath Information and Data Services), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to
Nursing and Allied Health), and the Cochrane Library. Key search terms included
day hospital, day care, ambulatory care, and outpatient clinic. We also searched
<italic>Index Medicus, </italic>British and international dissertation abstracts,
conference abstracts (Society for Research in Rehabilitation, British Geriatrics
Society), bibliographies of known trials, and other relevant articles and books.
We publicised our work through presentations at geriatric symposia and by
contacting authors of previous articles on day hospital
care.</p></sec><sec><title>Study appraisal and extraction of data</title><p>We
selected outcomes to reflect a previous definition of the purpose of day
hospital care: &#x201C;to facilitate and prolong independent living for the
elderly in the community.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> Thus
death, the need for institutional care, disability, hospital use, and resource
use were selected as quantitative outcomes. In anticipation of incomplete data
we also defined a global &#x201C;poor outcome&#x201D; comprising death or one of
the following (in order of preference): resident in institutional care, severe
disability at end of follow up, or deterioration in physical function during
follow up. The research reports were independently assessed by three reviewers
to establish eligibility, agree subcategories for the trials based on the
treatment comparison, and to extract data.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical
methods</title><p>When possible, studies were analysed on an intention to treat
basis. Surviving authors were contacted and asked to supply additional
information when necessary. Patients who were lost to follow up or for whom
outcome data were not available were excluded from the initial analysis.
However, they were included in &#x201C;best case&#x201D; (all missing data in
favour of day hospital care), &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; (all missing data recorded
at the average event rate for the trial), and &#x201C;worst case&#x201D; (all
missing data in favour of alternative care) sensitivity analyses.</p><p>We
calculated odds ratios (with 95&#x0025; confidence intervals) for the
dichotomous outcomes using standard methods. A fixed effects approach<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> was used initially and, if substantial
heterogeneity was present, we confirmed this with a random effects
approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> Outcomes were recorded at the
end of scheduled follow up.</p></sec></sec><sec
sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We identified 703 abstracts, of which 687
were not relevant to the review or of descriptive studies. Sixteen evaluated a
service fulfilling our definition of geriatric day hospital care. This analysis
includes 12 trials which recruited 2867 subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr"

We selected outcomes to reflect a definition of the core purpose of a geriatric
day hospital.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> We used a predetermined
definition of day hospital care<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> and
identified and categorised comparison services before collecting and analysing
data. We excluded day hospitals for patients with specific conditions such as
mental illness, dementia, or rheumatoid arthritis.</p><sec><title>Limitations of
the review</title><p>The main limitations of our review lie in the 30 years over
which the trials were done, during which health and social care policies will
inevitably have changed, and in the multinational location of the studies.
Nevertheless, our data provide the best evidence available on which to judge the
effectiveness of day hospitals.</p><p>A further problem is the limitations of
the trials themselves, in particular the lack of statistical power resulting
from small, heterogeneous trials. This raises the possibility of false positive
and false negative results. Furthermore, the amount of missing outcome data adds
uncertainty to most of our conclusions.</p><p>Publication bias remains a
possibility, but our search strategy was extensive and included contacting
authors of papers on day hospital care around the world. Many of the authors
were able to provide unpublished additional information. A funnel plot
analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> did not show any major
evidence of missing data.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>A big problem
was that most trials compared day hospital care with an alternative
&#x201C;active&#x201D; control. Only three trials<xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr"
rid="B17">17</xref> used a comparison group of patients who received neither
comprehensive care nor domiciliary rehabilitation. Compared with patients
receiving no comprehensive care, patients attending day hospitals had less
functional deterioration and institutional care and a small reduction in average
hospital bed use. However, there was considerable loss to follow up in these
three trials.</p><p>When day hospital services were compared with comprehensive
elderly care (integrated inpatient, outpatient, and domiciliary services), the
outcomes were largely similar. One interpretation is that day hospitals are
comparable with an alternative service for which there is considerable evidence
of effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> However, the question
arises whether day hospitals provide additional benefits when other
comprehensive elderly care services are already in place. Our systematic review
does not directly address this question.</p><p>We focused on a few specified
outcomes, but many other important outcome domains, including patient preference
and instrumental daily living activities, could not be examined as these
outcomes were not widely available. It was also difficult to determine a summary
statistic for disability because different measurement instruments were used and
analysed in different ways. Moreover, commonly used measures of disability may
be insensitive to change in the outpatient setting of a day hospital.<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> This may explain why six trials reported no
significant difference in disability outcome between day hospital and comparison
services. Future trials should incorporate measures of intrumental activities of
daily living as a more relevant and sensitive outcome.</p><p>Our analysis
suggests that attending day hospital may reduce patients&#x2019; use of hospital
and institutional care resources. However, costing studies need to balance any
possible savings with the direct costs of day hospital care. Several studies
have drawn attention to the expense of day hospital services.<xref
ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> For
six of the eight trials reporting cost information, day hospital care was more
expensive than the alternative treatment.</p><p>On the whole, the trials we
included took a pragmatic design approach and attempted to address a broad
question of overall efficacy of day hospitals. Given the diversity of patients
attending day hospitals and the corresponding diversity of interventions used,
future trials need to be large multicentre trials or should examine more focused
questions.</p></sec></sec><?mtl /hellip?>
